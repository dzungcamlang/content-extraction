I've searched this board, searched google, and it seems only the Japanese have unlocked it.

Which is fine, I know which quests they're referencing, except I'm stuck on the 7* three-hyper-monster Yian/Kut-ku/Rathian quest. How do you unlock that? Do you have to finish other hyper monster quests? Other requests? I'd really love a clear flowchart on unlocking the Shinobi Sky set.

Follow this chain first: http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/163462-monster-hunter-generations/74044124#19

Then the last quest in that chain: Hyper Tigrex+Hyper Seregios will unlock the set.

All right, I'm on part 6 of 7. Still amazes me that I can remember to check my gear and my items three times each, then forget to eat before a quest...

I did it. Finally! f*** me, it's tough finding a group for Savage Jho. If it's not hyper, no one wants to bother.

Oh, s***, I didn't even realize you couldn't make it without Alatreon parts, and can't even fight Alatreon until you're HR80...whelp, time to figure out something else to grind for.

Turns rooms are always a good thing to try out if you are going for unlocks, or if you want to farm something that not many people do. While not as fast as straight farming, it may be easier to get a group for it. Also there is the benefit of getting materials from things you may want to use in the future. Some of the groups on the board run turns rooms fairly regularly. They generally post them in there group threads, and as far as I know you don't have to be a member of the group to hop in.

Are people calling it Jho I was calling it Devil. What is this starting quest to this line and how do I get that one unlocked?
