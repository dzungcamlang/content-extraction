Preheat oven to 160Â°C. Line twelve 1/3-cup (80ml) muffin pans with paper cases.

Combine the butter, chocolate, hot water, coffee powder and coffee liqueur in a medium saucepan over low heat. Cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes or until chocolate and butter melt and mixture is smooth. Remove from heat. Add the sugar and stir to combine. Set aside for 5 minutes to cool slightly.
Step 3
Sift the combined flours and cocoa over the chocolate mixture and use a balloon whisk to stir until combined. Add the egg and stir to combine.

Pour the mixture evenly among the prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven for 15-20 minutes or until cooked through. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.
