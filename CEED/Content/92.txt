 Default Anybody with aftermarket steering wheel?
Am thinking about putting a mugen steering wheel on, but was wondering about the pros and cons of swapping out the steering wheel. I don't like airbags anyways. If anyone has pics of aftermarket steering wheel on the S, please post.

tks

They have Mugen and Spoon S2000 steering wheels in stock here at one of the shops. I thought it was against the law to remove the drivers side airbag...
They are nice though.

I think it's illegal here in cali too, plus if you do get an aftermkarket, nonairbag wheel, make sure you get a four-five point harness... like the one Greg has...

I am running Sparco harnesses and a rollbar, so the airbag really isn't of much use to me.
