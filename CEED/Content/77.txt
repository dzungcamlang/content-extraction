sublimation ink...is a special ink..and it will NOT work on cotton...and just barely work with 65/35 blend. It requires 100% polyester in white or some pastels..Reason is the ink on specail paper is turned into a gas by the heat and the pressure forces the gas into the garment where it bonds with the polyester fiber..what is on the coton fibers will wash out badly...

I use the 1400 for sublimation. It comes with claria ink which Espon describes as water resistant. It is not a pigment ink as most like to use in ordinary transfer. Some members have used Claria ink with JPSS paper.. I have not...So in short you can use the 1400 for other than sublimaton...do a search and you will find a long thread on using the 1400 and Claria ink...but you can also buy pigment ink in either carts or CIS

CIS...is continious ink supply...a bulk system...makes the ink cost less per transfer...but the hardware do do this would be 150-300 USD...and ink separate.. check with any of the vendors on here about pricing.. Whether or not you can print on dark shirts is not dependent on the printer but on the transfer paper you are using...such as Iron All for Dark..or similiar...again...check with the vendors here as to what papers they have for dark...personally I have not found any that I will use for commercial purposes..if I have an order for print on dark...I outsource to a DTG (direct to garment) operator..

if my memory serves me right... i think you can sublimate on 100% cotton now. all you have to do is spray it with that polymer chemical first.

i can't find now where I read it and there's also a website that sells the chemical.
i hope somebody will post it here.. especially the website address.
i haven't tried it myself but if i find that source again i might give a try.

the spray only puts a polymer base on the garment and it will not hold up to washing...I have been doing sublimation for almost 8 years and I have yet to find a spray or poilymer patch that I will use commercially...This method does not change the fibers of the cotton..only puts a transfer ON TOP of the garment and not fused...you would be better off to use something like JPSS ....it will be cheaper and will last longer than the spray on method..

On being the operative word: it's the polymer that gets sublimated, and not the cotton.

I totally aree with you Lewis the key word is "on". I have seen people use dye sub ink with transfer paper and it will print and adhere to cotton or 50/50 garments. The issue is as the poly coating is washed away so is the ink. The ink doesn't permeate the shirt fibers, just the poly coating. The answer to the question is yes it can be done, but it won't last past the poly coating. .... JB

No, you can not sublimate to a 100% cotton shirt. You can sublimate to a 50/50 blend shirt. But, it must be a shirt that is specifically designed for sublimation. The shirt will poly. on the OUTSIDE and cotton on the INSIDE.
