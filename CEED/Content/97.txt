Newt Gingrich Pushes Rumor That Hillary Clinton Got Debate Questions In Advance

Newt: And there are rumors that Hillary was actually given the questions in advance. I don’t know if it’s true but it would not shock me because they all operate in the same circle. They go to the same cocktail parties, they all know each other, her operatives and the news media producers on the left are all close friends, and this whole thing is a setup. But this particular case is such a vivid setup, and in the end it’s not going to work. The average American, in the end, is not going to say, “I’m so offended by something which happened 20 years ago in a beauty pageant that boy, that really turns me off.” And as they learn that the whole thing was a fraud, it was all a setup by the Clinton campaign and, as you point out, by the elite news media, I think they become even less likely to agree to this and I think the end result in the end will be it’s a diversion and we’ll go on to the big issues where Trump is winning on every single one of them.

Yeah, one of the “great minds” on the right.

Olbermann is 100% right. I would love to know why Putin/Russians are so anxious to get Trump elected that they are hacking into Democratic computers and leaking unfavorable documents. This is something we need to know before he becomes our President (God forbid).

It’s like I said - of course she knew the questions in advance. WE ALL know the questions that will be asked. We don’t know WHICH questions. You prepare for all of them. And your staff tells you which answers worked and which answers didn’t.

Then you watch the tapes of the debate, along with the dial-response of various groups watching in real time and you figure out what worked with each group, and what fell flat. And you prepare new answers for those, just in case they come up again, as well as rehearsing the ones that didn’t get asked last time.

Seriously, Trump is the guy who didn’t study for the test, got an F, and is bitching that the girl who spent the last week in the library studying must have cheated.

St. Ron was able to “win” that debate against Carter because he won the perception war even if all the pundits thought he sounded lost.

Dubya was able to study enough to bullshit people into believing he knew what he was talking about.

Romney “won” that first debate simply by overcoming the perception that he was dull and humorless.

In all three cases, the Republican won because he overcame the perception that had been hounding him.

Trump did nothing Monday night but reinforce the perception that he is a hothead with a massive ego and a serious inferiority complex.

I wonder if the increased repeating from Trump is a sign he is finally realizing he is failing and the stress is showing. As arrogant as he is, facing defeat is not going to go down well. He will be in denial of course, and that may be where the extra bluster comes from. I think we can expect to see and hear more wildness from him. He could blow up any day now. Reality is not a strong suit of a guy like Trump.

The lone vote against overriding the veto in the Senate was Reid. Sanders and Kaine didn’t vote, I’m guessing because they were on the campaign trail.

It’s also interesting that the GOP wouldn’t bother to schedule a vote for the first responders’ bill that Stewart was championing, but they’d go ahead with this one.

And the Conventional Wisdom is hardening around that conclusion. The scientific polls are remarkably consistent.

Meanwhile Trump’s simultaneously arguing that he won, and that he was cheated.

I wonder if the increased repeating from Trump is a sign he is finally realizing he is failing and the stress is showing. As arrogant as he is, facing defeat is not going to go down well. He will be in denial of course, and that may be where the extra bluster comes from. I think we can expect to see and hear more wildness from him. He could blow up any day now. Reality is not a strong suit of a guy like Trump.

Today was very stressful for Trump if you believe the campaign leaks & the conference call just reported on CNN.

He’s pissed about the negatives. Only talk about the (fake) positives.

Luckily for Trump, among the less politically addicted potential swing voters, there are no Kim Kardashian fans.
And of course, no one, man or woman, will be repelled by Trump body-shaming a mother.

ETA I see it isn’t a current comment. Still, if it gets passed around now, it is almost as good as if it was.

Oh my, Forbes found another Trump lie from the other night’s debate:

One more thing: The bombastic Republican presidential candidate said on Monday night that his FEC filing showed income of $694 million for the past year. It doesn’t, because in the document he freely mixed revenue with income, and it covers a period of 17 months.

Trump routinely plays freely with how he indicates income, debts, and revenue for reporting to the media (and on his filings).

There’s a reason he doesn’t want people digging. They can see he’s fudging the financials.

There’s a reason the IRS has been routinely digging into Trump’s financials year in and year out.

That Forbes piece also notes Trump’s value has dropped $800 million since he started running last year.

The lone vote against overriding the veto in the Senate was Reid. Sanders and Kaine didn’t vote, I’m guessing because they were on the campaign trail.

It’s also interesting that the GOP wouldn’t bother to schedule a vote for the first responders’ bill that Stewart was championing, but they’d go ahead with this one.

Oh my a kerfuffle.

Trump made fun of Kim Kardashian’s weight. Vanity Fair reports it was made today

Others have pointed out it was made in 2013.

Truthiness watch.

Trump has a very definite idea of what is attractive, and he’s more than willing to share, regardless of the consequences. He has no filter - not now, not ever.

His supporters love him for it, and women and minorities are the first to recognize the threat he poses to them.

So watch how Trump wont deny saying that about Kim K, but attack the media nonetheless.

Oh my a kerfuffle.

Trump made fun of Kim Kardashian’s weight. Vanity Fair reports it was made today

Others have pointed out it was made in 2013.

Truthiness watch.

Trump has a very definite idea of what is attractive, and he’s more than willing to share, regardless of the consequences. He has no filter - not now, not ever.

His supporters love him for it, and women and minorities are the first to recognize the threat he poses to them.

So watch how Trump wont deny saying that about Kim K, but attack the media nonetheless.

Let’s not forget the vulgar yam once said Heidi Klum was no longer a 10. (sad)

Heidi’s response:

re: #39 ObserverArt

You can tell it is getting down to the last days of the election. He’s up the repeating factor. Instead of merely saying it twice, four time now in some cases.

I noticed early in the debate that Trump’s responses were made up primarily from bits of his rally speeches. I don’t think he said anything new the entire time. Just recycled the same material.

And when he tried a couple of his zingers, also from previous speeches, they fell flat when said directly to Hillary’s face and with an opportunity for her to respond; not the response he was expecting from his rally experiences.

My prediction was that he’d do one debate and refuse to do more because he’s a coward. Certainly some of his surrogates have suggested it. But now I’m leaning toward Trump doing a second debate, believing if he really attacks Hillary he’ll win.

Trump isn’t used to dealing with attacks to his face, and his debate performance demonstrated that nicely. Hillary, on the other hand, has at least a little experience in handling that situation. ;)

Trump, being stupid as a bag of rocks, will try it though. But I suspect the response to any attacks on Hillary via Bill will get a response he’ll be sorry to have invoked.

Nothing like adding a little slutshaming to the fatshaming. More of their Outreach To Women Voters, like three thrice-married serial adulterers and Roger Ailes blaming the wife for her husband’s philandering. That’s sure to work, just like telling Blacks their lives are a constant festering shithole of poverty, drugs, and violence.

Faux News pretends to find more dirt:
Miss Universe Alicia Machado accused of threatening to kill judge in late ’90s

Shortly after she won her crown in the late ’90s, a judge in Venezuela accused Machado of threatening to kill him after he indicted her then-boyfriend for attempted murder.

Machado threatened “to ruin my career as a judge and … kill me,” Judge Maximiliano Fuenmayor said at the time.

She was not charged. Normally threatening to kill a judge will land you in the slammer in any part of the world if there is any evidence at all.
Freepers are nevertheless enthralled. The unsupported word of a Chavez-era Venezuelan judge is good enough for them, just as most of them wouldn’t have a problem with Putin running the US as well as Russia (to bring us back to the subject of the thread).

Re the new Reuters poll:

The Sept. 22-26 sample which they’re comparing this to had 751 Democrats and 570 Republicans out of a total sample of 1,704. That’s 44% D, 33% R, 23% other or D+11.

According to their Powerpoint, their Sept. 27-28 sample had 820 Democrats and 742 Republicans out of a total sample of 2,036. That’s 40% D, 36% R, and 24% other or D+4.

In other words, the sample became more friendly to Trump, which canceled movement toward Hillary.

Nothing like adding a little slutshaming to the fatshaming. More of their Outreach To Women Voters, like three thrice-married serial adulterers and Roger Ailes blaming the wife for her husband’s philandering. That’s sure to work, just like telling Blacks their lives are a constant festering shithole of poverty, drugs, and violence.

And that all they want is FREE GUBMINT STUFF, paid for by the labors of White Christian ‘Mericans.

So Kellyanne Conway said…

“”Rape would not exist if women were stronger.”

I guess the campaign is giving up on trying to get the women’s vote and is just going to solidify the knuckle-dragging alt-right men’s rights cavemen.

And wasn’t it said Kellyanne was good at this stuff? Maybe Trump told her to cut the serious shit and let’s get back to what he likes to say.

Just a day after The Arizona Republic paper endorsed its first ever Democrat for President, the paper has received death threats and countless cancellations.

“The Arizona Republic says it has received death threats and countless subscription cancelations over its endorsement of Hillary Clinton — the first time in the paper’s 126 year history it has ever supported a Democrat for president,” local 12News reported.

Phil Boas, director of the Arizona Republic’s editorial page said it had been crazy around there but it should have been expected as the paper had been giving Trump scathing coverage. He added, “We’re getting a lot of reaction both locally and national. I don’t believe true readers of the editorial page are surprised by this at all, because over the past year we have been writing scathing, scalding articles about Donald Trump.”

Boas explained, “The things he has done, making fun of disabled people and rolling back press freedoms. You know a guy who would do that and crush our freedoms in one area will do it in others as well.”

Before the first debate, there were a lot of leaks coming out of the Trump campaign that debate prep was going poorly, that Trump wasn’t taking it seriously. A lot of journalists and bloggers assumed it was just the campaign trying to push the expectations bar lower, so that when he showed up and didn’t seem totally unprepared, it would be seen as a victory.

Turns out, it was the truth.

I’m pretty sure Hillary prepared for both “Prepared Trump” and “Wingin’-It Trump”, and adjusted on the fly based on his reactions. So she waved the red cape, got him charging it, wore him down, and then stuck in the blade. She should be awarded both ears and the tail.

Next time, MAYBE he’s better prepared, maybe not. So what traps does she lay for the next debate? In fencing, you don’t rely on the same attack repeatedly. You use a different attack the next time, perhaps even making it look like the one you used before, so they defend against THAT while your blade goes elsewhere.

We’ll see. My money’s on her.

Trump is still targeting his base. Most Americans, even conservative ones, aren’t going to hear that, and aren’t going to understand it anyway.

But, 3M votes. Obama won in 2012 by 5M. I would say 3M is about the lowest I expect Clinton to win by. That number is just another attempt to throw her “victory” in doubt to those that love to wave their guns around.

Probably a national ad buy. Still stupid. He may be highly constrained in terms of the slots available because Clinton’s team has had such an fundraising lead that they were able to commit early and reserve so much targeted swing state airtime. If he wants to preempt her he has to pay a higher tier rate, assuming such tiers are even available, so either way he’s left getting much less bang for his buck.

Fox News on FB has a column from some pundit from the NY Post “Trump Clears The Bar Beautifully At First Debate”. What a crock of shit!

It reminds me of a movie review I read years ago in the Ithaca Journal, about the Bo Derek “Tarzan”. It tried so hard to be a favorable review, that I concluded the critic either had lost a bet, or was trying to win one that required him to write a good review of an execrable movie. My favorite bit was when he said, “Sure, using slow motion in the fight scenes didn’t work, but maybe the director is using that to tell us that violence itself doesn’t work!”

So psycops. The crooked caller is the Crooked.

This could be the story that not only makes him the crooked one…the true anti-communism conservatives could drop him and thus he will be cooked too.

I bet things are going to go late into the night at Trump Tower. I hope everyone has their helmets on, I imagine there will be a lot of shit being thrown around the room in anger.

Trump angry at allies conceding he lost debate

Donald Trump is angry that his aides and advisers have conceded to reporters — largely without attribution — that the Republican nominee struggled in his first presidential debate.

In a conference call with surrogates Wednesday afternoon, Trump aides made clear the Republican nominee is upset that his allies publicly acknowledged they pushed him to change his preparation and tactics before his next bout with Hillary Clinton. And he wants them to stop it immediately.

The message was “not subtle,” a source familiar with the call said.

Trump wants his supporters to make an energetic defense of his performance and refuse to concede that he didn’t nail it.
Trump’s team told surrogates to say that Trump successfully reinforced his outsider status, contrasting him with Clinton as a status quo candidate, and to zero in on one-liners that they saw as successful — particularly his repeated line that Clinton has been in public life nearly 30 years with little to show for it.

A Trump spokesperson declined to comment on the call.

The pushback comes amid reports that advisers hoped Trump’s missteps against Clinton in the first debate would convince the Republican nominee to concentrate on his message and tactics before they debate again. Aides had said Tuesday and earlier Wednesday that they have delivered the message (gingerly, one said) that the first debate didn’t go well.

“Yes, he’s been made aware,” one adviser said.

Aides and advisers hoped Trump’s refusal to participate in traditional debate preparation sessions — instead favoring the impromptu, off-the-cuff approach that helped him through the GOP primaries — might be eased after Monday night.

One ally described Trump as the kind of guy who can’t simply be told a stove is hot — he has to touch it to see for himself.

Another adviser said because of that reality, Monday’s poor performance could be the best thing that could have happened to Trump.

Trump, advisers said, had lines ready to hit back at predictable Clinton attacks.

“He just didn’t use them,” an adviser said. “Nobody is really sure why, but we’re all certain he won’t let opportunities pass next time around.”
Ahead of their October 9 town hall style debate in St. Louis, part of the problem, one source said, is that Trump doesn’t yet seem to grasp that he needs to expand his base of supporters to bring in new voters who are not yet sold on his temperament, policy positions or readiness to be president.

When Trump was told Tuesday that he should do some things differently, he responded that his approach is what his base likes.

Klys…I’m sure many (all?) women feel the same way as you do. Rachel put up a stat that 76%(?) of women felt Trump was out of line on the comment. I don’t quite remember the number, but it was high.

And, I want to add, many men can also sympathize. The big difference is men don’t get slammed for it. Many men say it doesn’t bother them, but if they were honest, they fight the image issues too. It is society wide.

I just saw what had to be the same one (the first I’ve seen) tonight on the ABC Evening News (NYC station) - just as slickly-produced and content-free as ever. I know the NY Metro market covers NJ and Connecticut as well, but I doubt Trump has much of a chance to carry any of them.

I met a fellow in Las Vegas on my birthday last May - a fellow Umphreak - we partied too hard and shared a lot of laughs.

Dude is over 250 lbs.

He says “Happy Birthday!” *again* to me, I raise my drink. Finally he asked me “How old are you?”

“34.”

“No. Fuckin’. Way!”

I learned that this very heavyset man I just met and partied with was 26 years old. I couldn’t believe it at first. Dude looked like he was almost 40.

He later confided to me at dinner later that night that he hated being fat and he didn’t know how to handle it, that he’d tried everything, on and on. I started crying. He gave me this huge bear hug that I’ll never forget and he said “Charlie, if you ever need a bodyguard…” I laughed my ass off.

Point is, yes, males have body image issues too.

I’ve learned that *anything* that pertains to men vs. women that women bear a greater burden over life spans.

Man, the state of the Republican isn’t even about politics anymore; it’s about shit like this.

We have a group of old dudes with long track records of sexual misconduct dumping on a women for gaining 10 pounds, to “protect” another gross old dude because he can’t stop talking about women in general as though they existed only for his convenience.

Which is a pretty good summary of the state of fucking play: motherfuckers so incontinent that everything triggers their feelings and they fly off the handle, motherfuckers so vain that other people exist to only to arouse them or serve them, and motherfuckers so lickspittle-ish that they’ll spit or swallow anything so long as they get to feel like they’re special.

I suggest the debate coordinators replace the podiums with treadmills or stair-steppers, and require each speaker to work out while the other talks.

Neither candidate looks like a marathon runner, TBH, but I suspect Hillary could outlast The Donald easily on a treadmill or stair-stepper. I got no evidence of such. It’s just a hunch.

Odd thing is, Machado is much more classically feminine in her beauty than Melania is. The fuller figure has almost always been considered more feminine and desirable.

It’s only in our contemporary era that skinny women are thought of as the ideal. I have some misc. thoughts about this which I might post later, with a link to a news story that will illustrate my point.

A fetish for skinny women may be indicative of something else. Namely, the skinnier a woman the more androgynous she can be made to look.

And remember, he and Melania watched Paris Hilton’s sex tape together. (which was even more gross, because he had known Paris since she was a little girl.)

Now there is a piece of information I didn’t need.

He didn’t use them, because maybe there is a shred of a wee voice that tells him Clinton is just ready and waiting for him to use those attacks and has a sharpened, poisoned shiv ready to slice his balls off and shove them down his throat when he does.

QFT.

Trump knows that Hillary would have savaged him much, much worse than she already did on live TV, had he tried anything with either Bill or Chelsea.

Dead thread, but I wanted to mention tha.t Melania looks too plasticky for my tastes, especially her face, while Alicia looks 100% real. Plus, Melania looks perpetually angry.

re: #295 teleskiguy

I met a fellow in Las Vegas on my birthday last May - a fellow Umphreak - we partied too hard and shared a lot of laughs.

Dude is over 250 lbs.

He says “Happy Birthday!” *again* to me, I raise my drink. Finally he asked me “How old are you?”

“34.”

“No. Fuckin’. Way!”

I learned that this very heavyset man I just met and partied with was 26 years old. I couldn’t believe it at first. Dude looked like he was almost 40.

He later confided to me at dinner later that night that he hated being fat and he didn’t know how to handle it, that he’d tried everything, on and on. I started crying. He gave me this huge bear hug that I’ll never forget and he said “Charlie, if you ever need a bodyguard…” I laughed my ass off.

Point is, yes, males have body image issues too.

I’ve learned that *anything* that pertains to men vs. women that women bear a greater burden over life spans.

That’s not a body-image issue, it’s a metabolic disorder reducing quality and length of life. People like me are fat because we eat too much sugar and sit in a recliner, other people exercise and eat right, but their body betrays them. There’s no justice in these matters.

At 12, I wasn’t interested… but she was beautiful.” He also admitted to watching Paris Hilton’s sex tape with Knauss, despite knowing her since the age of 12 and being very close friends with the Hilton Family.

I hung out with this dude for maybe a total of half a dozen hours. Still, what he told me at dinner just made my heart ache. You right, though. These human bodies are nothing if not unpredictable.

Nope, not a chance. I’ve been left before, I’ve left people, but absolutely no woman I have ever been involved with would touch him. Guaranteed. And at least some of them, in their day, he might have tried to, er, woo.
