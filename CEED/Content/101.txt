I love this museum so so much! It seems almost endless! They did an amazing job with all of the displays; truly capturing the size of the aircrafts as well as appointing it to a particular time period. There's no way you can honestly get through this museum in one day....not if you're really stopping and reading and learning about...More .

The museum is absolutely huge. The new addition is incredible as well. The presidential collection is so cool, because you can walk through them.This is the closest a person can get to many of these aircraft. We really enjoyed the planes and the displays. Very cool.

Sarah R.
Indianapolis, Indiana.
Considering a visit in October with my 2- and 4-year-olds. Would previous visitors consider this attraction "kid-friendly" for this age? Are there interactive exhibits, or mostly "look and see?" We will be driving up from Cincinnati, so want to see if it will be worth the trip for the little ones.
