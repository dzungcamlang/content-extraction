The 55-year-old singer was led away by police after an incident at Heathrow Airport
Britain's Got Talent star Susan Boyle has written a letter of apology to airline staff after a heated row at Heathrow.

The singer was led away from the British Airways lounge by police after an incident on Monday.

And now she is writing to staff to personally apologise after the heated dispute, which occurred while on her way back to her home in West Lothian, Scotland.

Witnesses said a confused-looking SuBo was shouting, "I've done nothing wrong, I've done nothing wrong" during the commotion.

The singer's management team said the airport episode was triggered by her Asperger's syndrome.

They also said future European tours may be limited to to road journeys to prevent future incidents.

SuBo's spokesman said: "The incident at Heathrow occurred because of Susan's well-documented Asperger syndrome.
"It is a life-long condition and one of the many characteristics is outbursts.

"She continues to enjoy her music career. That is very important to her and brings happiness to her life whilst trying to balance the many challenges that Aspergers brings."

The singer has previously admitted that the condition can leave her feeling depressed and can cause mood swings.

It isn't the first time SuBo has had an airport meltdown.
Last month she was reportedly spotted shouting for help at Derry Airport in Northern Ireland.
Susan was led into a sideroom by airport staff who comforted her.

She later insisted she would bounce back and said she was excited by a new album which will be out at Christmas.

Susan still lives in the same home where she has lived for many years in Blackburn, West Lothian, and remains active as a church volunteer.
