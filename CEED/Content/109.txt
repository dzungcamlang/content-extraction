“Best sushi experience”.
Reviewed 9 January 2017.
Chef Yasuda is the perfectionist you need to have a great Japanese sushi experience. As we are seated in a full house service, he still took the time to greet us properly and after our drinks were selected and served, he started us with a simple sushi to start us off - which was far from simple, it was amazing...More .

“Greatest sushi of my life”.

Yasuda Sushi Bar was HIGH on my culinary list for my visit to Tokyo. I wanted a fine dining experience with a sushi master and I got one. Even my friend, who had never had sushi in his life was blown away by the fresh sushi and miso soup. An amazing experience sat in a small 9 seat restaurant. It...More .

“It's like a dinner party with the chef”.
Reviewed 28 December 2016.
Eight seat sushi bar where Chef Yasuda slices, seasons and serves you sushi. We ordered the omakase and a sake from his hometown. So far the best sushi that we have ever had. Very warm and inviting place. He gave us tips on where to go for food and he is quite funny.

“Really over-rated for any experienced sushi lovers!”.

Lets focus on food, (beside chef's subjective comments on other restaurants), the quality and presentation are really average. Very limited selection on sake. When chef focus on talking, the sushi quality sacrificed.

Awesome experience, chef yasuda is entertaining and full of stories as he serves up his nigiri pieces. The rice was amazing. Get the yasuda order, or whatever it's called, where he gives you what he's got. Small spot, no place to hang out beforehand, get reservations well in advance online. It seems to be mostly popular with tourists as it...More .

My wife and I had our honeymoon in Japan, and I wasn't going give up a chance to try out Chef Yasuda's sushi. I made my counter seats reservation at Sushi Bar Yasuda at least two months in advance through their website and subsequently through emails. The location was easy to find for us.

I have been to the NY Sushi Yasuda, which he no longer has any connection to, several times and think it's one of the best sushi restaurants in the city, especially given the price. Needless to say, I wanted to come eat at Yasuda's own place when I was going to be in Tokyo. I had some idea of what...More .

Back in 2001 we had the pleasure of dining omakase at Sushi Yasuda NYC when Yasuda-san still owned it.

“Overrated, expensive tourist trap”.
Reviewed 16 November 2016.
We left very disappointed. Chef Yasuda's complaining about this and that was funny for about 2 minutes. The omakase was below average, and compared with the price it was way overrated with too much cheap imported farm salmon being used, probably squeezing the margins further for every stupid foreigner (including myself) entering his restaurant. It is quite unbelievable that someone...More .
