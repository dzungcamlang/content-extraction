Did anyone ever get refunds from edreams?
11 September 2012, 17:38
Many people on this forum seems to have problems with edreams (and I have nothing good to say whatsoever), but did anyone receive refunds at all?

I booked a return ticket from London to Bucharest with edreams, and the overall price was £ 132.98 but 300.98€ was taken from my card. After many emails I was told I would receive a refund for the outstanding amount, but I have not received anything and no replies to my latest emails.

Dear customer

We have checked your booking record and we have noticed the error made by the airline company during the comfirmation process . Please note that Edreams will assume the overcharged amount .

Please provide us with your bank account details and we will refund your money. '

I never understand this type of question. How does what happened for anyone else have any bearing on your refund? I am sure people have received refunds.

Can't you just file a dispute with your credit card company? In any case, this is not an unusual amount of time, unfortunately, to wait for a refund.

Assuming it's not too late, get in touch with your creditcard provider and dispute the charge.

I'm sure you'll get the refund, there are complaints here about edreams but they are a big company that have been going for years.

Thanks Chrella good to hear. After the reading the negative reviews on here I had serious doubts about how big edreams are. I have spent more than two months on this and was told the refund would take 7-10 working days from the 14th, so wasnt sure what to think.

Why going with a middleman?

Apart real discount or airline not selling directly (rare..) any normal ticket will cost the same on the airline website.

All airline website I've visited this year even promise to have the best price or they pay back the difference.

I have been chasing a refund from eDreams for over 6 weeks, they took money from my account and still will not reply or answer as to when I will get it back.

DO NOT USE them evewr, they lie constantly on the phone and charge you £1.53p per minute as well and never answer emails. I have contacted my bank and also contacted the police.

Slightly pointless post if that's all you're going to say.

No one can help you apart from your credit card company. What did they say when you contacted them?
