This ain’t a good start.... remains to be seen if the Goat is
dead....... fingers crossed!!!!!

We’ll see, it’s a seven game series and a lot can happen, but no doubt this was a huge victory for the Cleveland Indians. Also: Terry Francona is now undefeated in World Series games. The more you know.

Well there’s a Game 2 tomorrow, an hour earlier than today’s game due to weather concerns. A win there and the Cubs have gone 1-1 on the road, which is what you’re supposed to do.

Another Indians win? Well then Chicago might start panicking. We’ll be covering that for the Guardian, hopefully you’ll be joining us. Thanks for following along with tonight’s liveblog, especially those who contributed! Ciao!

Cubs 0-6 Indians, FINAL

Miguel Montero is in to pinch-hit here. Allen falls behind 2-0. It feels like with a 6 run lead the mission should just be throw strikes, but given the circumstances, it’s hard not to understand if his command isn’t 100% ideal.

He gets the benefit of a high strike call on the next pitch. 2-1. His next pitch is a definite strike. 2-2. Progressive Field gets REAL LOUD and Montero swings and misses at the next pitch and IT GETS LOUDER! The Indians have won Game 1 of the World Series

Russell takes ball one and then swings and misses at Allen’s second pitch. 1-1. He swings and foul tips one into the mitt for strike two. 1-2. He swings and misses at a high fastball and that’s out number two. The Cubs are down to their final out of the game.

Stuck in Cleveland without a functioning TV. What to do? Get on Google and find your coverage. It’s great, much like the early days of radio coverage when one had to wait while the announcer recreated the sounds of the bat and ball and the crowd cheering!

Chisenhall is up with one on, two out. Grimm falls behind him 2-0. Yeah this is the Grimm I remember. He lines the next pitch over the shortstop’s head.

And, guess what, we have a pitching change, although in this case, Maddon’s 100% in the right to make a move here.

Justin Grimm is still out there. I’d imagine if the game were closer, there’d be someone else up. Also up, is Carlos Santana who’s… (struggles to come up with another reference) Uh is ready to hit a soul sacrifice?

No, never mind, there’s nobody on base to move up.

In any case, he strikes out badly on a unchecked swing on a 2-2 count. Not so “Smooth” right? Right?

Okay I’m getting a tad loopy here.

Well the good news for Chicago is that Miller’s probably not going to be available to for for more than an inning in Game 2. That’s not nothing. It feels like Francona might have leaned too heavily on his best pitcher, but he knows the old “teams that win Game 1 of the World Series” factoid.

Rizzo is up. Miller gets ahead of him 1-2. The crowd starts to get loud again. Every two strike count with Miller is an event. Miller’s next pitch is a ball. 2-2. Rizzo fouls off the next pitch. Still 2-2. Miller’s next pitch, a slider just off the plate, gets called for a ball.

The crowd doesn’t like it, but it did break. Rizzo swings at the next pitch but he doesn’t quite get a good swing at it and it ends up just being a wind-wavering flyout that Davis eventually tracks down. Miller’s thrown 38 pitches already.

Nobody is feeling good about a team called the Indians winning in 2016, hopefully their own fans are even a little bit guilty

There’s definitely a conversation to be had about the Indians’ name, one that I imagine will only be amplified over the course of the serious. It should be had, in my opinion.

Maddon keeps Grimm in the game to face Napoli. Grimm falls behind 2-0 before getting a strike call on a nifty curveball. 2-1. He throws another curve and gets Napoli to ground out.

And the maddening Maddoning has begun. Strop gets Davis to pop out to second and Maddon brings out a new reliever. We’re going to somehow see the entire Cubs bullpen over the next 2+ innings.

Oh and Contreras is doing the catching now and Albert Almora Jr is in right.

David Ross is up with a chance for a storybook moment and he gets a 3-1 count with the bases loaded. He takes the next pitch. And that’s a 3-2 count now.

This is the biggest pitch of the game right here.

Ross attempts to check his swing on strike three and… HE CAN’T! That’s two straight strikeouts from Miller (what did I tell you?) and the Cubs load the bases with nobody out and can’t push a run home.

That feels like the game. (But please keep reading.)

Wilson Contreras is up, pinch-hitting for Coghlan. He flies out but it’s not enough to score the runner from third. That’s one out. Miller is two strikeouts or one double play away of getting out of the jam. (The first option is more likely with Miller.)

Baez is up next with two hitters on and nobody out. He immediately falls behind 0-2. Baez swings and fouls off the next pitch. It really looks like he’s lunging and you’d think Miller would be able to exploit that and put him away here rather easily.

Instead Baez lines a single and the bases are loaded and nobody out. Wow did this game’s dynamic just change dramatically in the span of a few batters.

Lefthander Andrew Miller, who has been frighteningly unhittable throughout this postseason, is up to face Schwarber. What a welcome back to the major leagues this has to be, from Kluber to Miller.

Schwarber actually works a full count here, which should be as good as a solid base hit. And in fact, he takes a walk on ball four. The tying run is now at the plate.

Email from Andrew M.:

Do you really think Kluber will play 3 times this series? Try and do a MadBum and make a long relief outing? If so do you think he’ll be as effective

It’s possible, honestly. Part of the reason Miller is warming up here is that Francona would like to use Kluber on short rest for a potential Game 4.

But he is back to start the top of the 7th where he immediately allows Zobrist to hit a a single and that’s the end of Kluber’s night. Here comes Andrew Miller.

It’s Pedro Strop time in Cleveland, the RHP ends up being the first reliever used in this World Series, which is something not everybody can say. He’s going to be facing Perez. Who he strikes out.

Is Guyer going to be bunting with a runner on second with nobody out? He might not get a chance, he takes two balls.

Meanwhile there is stirring in the Chicago bullpen. Lester might not be long here. It might depend on this at-bat.

Lester throws a strike. 2-1. Guyer swings away at the next pitch. 2-2. This at-bat has taken a turn. Don’t think he’s bunting now. Guyer takes a pitch on the corner for a strike.

Lester’s back up. He hasn’t been terrible, it’s really just that first inning where he came close to unraveling.

Why do I keep saying things like that. Ramirez hits a leadoff double off of him the second I finish that sentence.

Rizzo is up, to see if he can do anything. On 1-1 he swings wildly at a pitch like he’s not even sure it occupies the same dimension as he does. On 1-2… Kluber doesn’t get the call. 2-2, Rizzo pops up and that’s it for Kluber this inning.

And maybe for this game? Miller has been throwing with purpose. It would be… unorthodox to pull Kluber the way he’s been pitching but, well, Francona’s been unorthodox with his bullpen use all postseason long.

Here’s Bryant who falls behind 0-2. He’s a real good hitter too, it feels necessary to point that out. Kluber throws a ball and then gets Bryant to swing on a breaking ball that he just pops up. That’s out two.
