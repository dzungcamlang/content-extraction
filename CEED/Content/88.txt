ms3 brake fluid capacity
I got "elected" to do some brake flushing, don't ask...
So how much fluid is needed for an full brake flush, rough numbers are ok. (ie bottle and half at 500ml)

Thanks

I don't have an exact number but I remember using close to 3/4 of 32oz bottle I bought for a full flush.

I used about half a liter of ATE super blue when I had my car done.

Edit:

I don't think you can get it on Amazon anymore, but I found it here on eBay:

Cool, so 500ml bottle for each and 3rd to top off each them. Am going use motul rfb600

Also I was looking at the ate type 200, and the super blue, what confused me is they both have the same boiling temps so other than the obvious, one is blue what is the different?

ms3 brake fluid capacity
I think I used over half a liter. The can felt under that, but no where near a quarter full when as was said and done. That was for both my Mazdas too. 

The type 200 is the replacement for the Super Blue here in the States. It's exactly the same from what I've read. It's just the legal color for brake fluid. Apparently blue is bad.

They offered a blue and orange so for those who are track junkies that needs to change brake fluid often so that you know you did a full flush correctly. So if your fluid is orange currently, you pour the blue, then flush the brake fluid til it came out blue then you stop and then vise versa. The properties isn't any different other than color but they were recently banned to sell them. Stupid laws.

I have a 96 900ss and 02 998 since new. I bleed the fluid about every three years but suck the fluid out of the reservoirs and replace it several times a year. Both bikes still have all the original seals in the clutch and brakes.

And who in the hell is gonna check to see if your brake fluid is blue ?? LOL I bet 1 out of 50 cops even knows about it even that. What a waste of tax dollars.. we cant decide on a budget but we can decide what color brake fluid should be. Im just amazed.
