How does each nucleotide differ?

All nucleotides have a 5-carbon sugar, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The bases are the differences. There are four bases in DNA: adenine, thymine, cytocine, and g…uanine. In RNA, the base Uracil replaces thymine. Adenine on one strand will always pair with a thymine on the other, and vice versa, while a cytosine on one strand will always pair with a guanine on the other strand. In RNA adenine will always pair with a uracil, and there is no thymine. (MORE)

What nucleotide is different in RNA than in DNA?

Nucleotides which are DNA related are Adenine, Thymine, Cytosine and Guanine. In RNA the bases are the same exept that Thymine loses an alkyl group and becomes Uracil.

What is the difference between nucleotide and nucleoside?

A nucleoside (with an s) is a nitrogenous base covalently attached to a (ribose or deoxyribose) sugar but does not have a phosphate group attached.    A nucleotide (wit…h a t) consists of a nitrogenous base, a sugar, and a   phosphate group.   So, a nucleotide is a "nucleoside mono-phosphate" or a nucleoside with a phosphate group attached.
