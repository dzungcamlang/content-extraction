Example 1

Estimate f ' (2.5) given the following table of values:


Answer
For each problem, we rearrange the information given into a more familiar table, then calculate the slopes.



As h approaches 0 from the right we find the slopes 6 and 10. As h  approaches 0 from the left we find the slopes 5 and 9. We estimate that f ' (2.5) is in between 9 and 10.

Example 2

Estimate g ' (4) given the following table of values:



Answer


We estimate that g ' (4) is in between 0.2 and 0.4. Notice that we used g  instead of f for the function name; this changes the labels on the tables but nothing else.

Example 3

Estimate f ' (2) given the following table of values:



Answer


It looks like f ' (2) is between 1 and 2. We had more values of a + h to the left of 2 than we did to the right of 2, but that's not going to change the way we do things.
