Auto lift gate won't latch/lock!
I bought my Cherokee back in March and everything has been great until today. I noticed that my lift gate won't latch and lock. I scheduled service with the dealer, but they won't be able to service it until Monday.

I'm concerned about security since the lift gate can be lifted up easily, and it seems the alarm system isn't activated when the lift gate isn't latched. Another bonus is that the dashboard remains lit and won't turn off.

Does anyone have an easy fix?

Thanks!

Fuse? Or a switch that tells the system that the Door is open.

Will it latch if you push on the door? I had a problem with mine when I first put in the cargo liner, but after it conformed to the space, that went away.

The door won't physically latch. When I press the close button it faintly chimes twice but doesn't close.

Try like Audog suggested, manually push it closed and see if it locks.

I put extra pressure on the door, but it still won't latch.

Did you try pushing the button to see if the latch is engaged? It may have closed the electronic latch before the door was closed, mine has done this before

I read elsewhere: Disconnect negative(-) battery terminal (maybe 10mm wrench) for about 1/2 hour to reset computer.

I had the same problem once earlier, the latch would not lock for 2 days, and finally it did on its own. I scheduled an appointment but had to cancel as it started working again on its own.
