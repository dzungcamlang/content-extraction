be6y8e2u.jpg so i added flares because of all the chipping in my wheel wells and I think it doesn't look right with the tires they are in too far I know the obvious answer would be to get wider tires but these bfgs have over 50% left on them so I was debating using wheel spacers to knock the wheels out a bit any thoughts?

If you do go with ones that bolt to the stock lugs, not the cheap , and small, 1/4 inch ones. Those caused a vibration for me and you couldn't really tell they were there. I have heard though it puts more stress on the bearing and oth components because of the increase in leverage. Another rout to go though would be wheels with a greater back spacing or more negative off set

Wheels with more offset will cause the same stress as spacers. I would not touch spacers. Have seen what happens when they come loose. Jmo

Thanks interesting reading on them I might just try them I like my wheels and I'll probably put the bfgs on my stock rims for winter and buy new tires in the spring for these anyways so I can get something to fill the wheel well better then

There are no pros when it comes to wheel spacers as they add stress to the bearings and I have seen them crack and egg out the lug holes, imo they shouldn't be made for vehicles.
 
As for fender flare looks they look funny and out of proportion on a stock trucks as it makes the body look wider then the wheel base stance unless you have the wider tires to match the body stance of the flares which that's what there really designed for.
 
I use to have a set of BFG ATs a long time ago and they like picking up small rocks and slinging them, why don't you get wheel well liners if you don't like the chips inside the wells?

Running them in the rear is not even as close as bad as running them in the front as the front is exposed to far more leverage then the rear due to left to right turning of the wheels, going around turns at speed etc.
