Looks great! I actually like the three time effect created by the tape lines and what I'm assuming is dust or over spray. 

Definitely a first

/\ agreed, if it's your doing or it's overspray, the band around the graphics with shading outside looks interesting. 

Total standout, hope you drive nicely...you'll be easy to find!

It would probably be hard to replicate and make it look right. Although the anthracite grey is an awesome color!

HA! That's pretty slick looking, although it first reminded me of the jeeps in Jurassic Park, or one of the zebra painted safari cars. Kind of looks like a wrap for some advertising. Anywho -- I like the overspray as shading idea to give it the 3D look, if you could pull that off it would give it a real industrial look, very cool. Two things stand out though -- the black circle aka gas lid. I think if you were to incorporate it into a strait lined shape it would blend in better and not stand out so much. Same with the blacked corners. I would almost say peel them and add them into the over all scheme. But, that's just my and my opinion. Well done man!
