How do I convert the number of the month (1, 2, 3) to the month (Jan, Feb, Mar) in excel?

My $0.02: For a number from 1 to 12, I'd use
=TEXT(DATE(2000,A1,1),"mmm")

What do you mean "convert"?
Are you trying to retain the entire date but change the way it is displayed or are you trying to extract the month and put it in a cell by itself?

While changing the way the date is displayed is my ultimate goal, extracting the month number, i.e. 5 = May...11=Nov from another column that I hide within the spreadsheet will also solve my problem. I am learning more about Vlookup and this excel function looks like a promising approach.

To redesign the way your date’s display you have all the choices offered 
in the Date section of cell formatting or you can “roll your own” using a Custom Format.
But for now try this:

With your Date in A1 try this in cell B1:

=TEXT(A1,”MMMMM”) 
for the first letter of the month

=TEXT(A1,”MMMM”) 
for the month spelled out completely

=TEXT(A1,”MMM”) 
for the 3 letter abbreviation of month

If you have a cell with just a number from 1 thru 12 you are going to 
have to use some type of =IF function, or VBA code to match up the 
number with the correct Month.
