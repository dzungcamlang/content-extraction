Why Ozzy Osbourne's Other Daughter Refused To Be On 'The Osbournes'
Everybody knew Ozzy Osbourne because he was the lead singer of Black Sabboth and also because he bit off the head of a bat on stage that one time. But he really became famous when he let MTV film a reality TV show about him, his family and all about his domestic life! I used to watch The Osbournes all the time. I LIVED for their drama and every weird thing the family would get up to. Remember when a dog therapist visited the house?! But by far, the weirdest part about the show was the blurred out figure lurking around the house. It was Aimee, the eldest daughter. And she's revealed why she was never on the show and why she's no longer close to the family!
Everybody thinks the Kardashians were the first family to rule reality TV but they weren't! It was all about the Osbournes! 
Keeping Up with the Kardashians has NOTHING on The Osbournes. This family was actually crazy and out of control all the time!
Remember when they pranked Sharon by telling her that her dog had died? 

Real talk: that's the worst prank in the entire world. I felt so bad for Sharon!
Even though Kelly and Jack were the focus on the show as the kids, there was another Osbourne named Aimee! And now she's telling everyone why she was never on the show and what happened between her and her family.
