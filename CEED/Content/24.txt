Reformatting is similar to doing a factory reset on Android. A factory reset - or a master reset - erases all of the current information on a device in order to restore the software to the original settings (those that were on the phone prior to customizing it). This is typically done when there are consistent bugs with the phone that continue even after seeking help or troubleshooting the different issues. To reformat Android phones that still work, navigate to Settings -> Backup & Reset -> Factory Data Reset. To reformat Android phones that no longer work, boot your phone into Recovery Mode, then choose "recovery" and "wipe data/factory reset" from the options.

Boot your phone into Recovery Mode. If your Android device will not boot normally, you can perform a factory reset from the Recovery boot menu. Press and hold the correct buttons while your phone is powered off. The buttons vary from device to device.[1]
Nexus devices - Volume Up, Volume Down, and Power
Samsung devices - Volume Up, Home, and Power
Moto X - Volume Down, Home, and Power
Other devices generally use Volume Down and Power, while other phones with hard UIs can use Power and Home, since Power and Volume Down in devices with true home buttons will make it boot to factory test mode.

Select "wipe data/factory reset". Confirm that you want to reset the phone by selecting "Yes - delete all user data". Your phone will now begin the reset process.
