Intro: Origami Post-it box.
This is a tidy little box that is cool yet useful. It's also a great way to recycle all of your used sticky notes at work. Just make ...
1Step 1: Peel off a sticky note with the sticky part up.
2Step 2: Fold from point to point in half.
3Step 3: Then fold in half again from point to point.
4Step 4: Take all 4 points and fold to center.
5Step 5: It should look like this.
6Step 6: Now fold to first crease from point and do this on all four points.
7Step 7: It should look like this now. You will notice that there are four squares near the center that make a square, this is the bottom of your box.
8Step 8: Fold the point to the first crease and do this on all four points.
9Step 9: This is what you will have when you FLIP IT OVER.
10.
Step 10: Remember the four squres in the middle? You will cut on the crease to the corner of the four squares. You will do FOUR cuts on TWO opposing ends.
11.
Step 11: Look closely at the cuts. There are only FOUR.
12.
Step 12: Fold in to make the side.
13.
Step 13: Now fold the opposite side as shown. You should have two points touching inside and the general shape of the box with two tabs sticking out.
14.
Step 14: The two tabs will then be folded in to create the remaining sides. All points should be at the bottom of the box touching with no overlap.
15.
Step 15: Now take your trusty Uhaul pen and flatten the edges of the box. Done!
You can make two and have a lidded box.If you're smarter than the average bear you'll figure out how to do it without the cuts.
Step 9: This is what you will have when you FLIP IT OVER.

<p>Hooray, I think I figured out how to do it without cutting the corners! It doesn't stay very nicely, though. Any tips on that?</p>

<p>Thank you! Great instructable for lazy office days! :)</p>
Finally! My first successful instructable! Thank you!
Nice. it help me a lot. Try to visit here also http://www.captainnotepad.com/.
THANK YOU!!!
can you do this with any other paper to make it bigger?
Sure, I think thats a good idea! <br>
thank you it came out a little lager and great I love it!
For the slightly crafty people who like fabric, you can do this by using fabric stiffener, maybe even ModPodge. Once you have a firmer piece of fabric, you can make your folds, and cuts, and there are no limits to size. (Did anyone ever find a slightly larger than? I mean, square post-its are one size fits all, right? 3&quot;, I think. So you'd have to have something about 3-1/4&quot; or even 3-1/2&quot; to be larger. But regular paper comes in colors, and even cardstock does too. I still want to try this with fabric.
I saw an origami box book where you use fatquarters precut quilting fabric - perfect for making wedding favors (daughter's wedding is in a barn). You've inspired me. <br>
I LOVE this!! I've become addicted to making these little boxes! They're very useful!
Thank you! They are fun to make in all sizes!
I mean, it's cute and everything... but what exactly do you have *that* tiny that needs a box?
Earrings!
Well, you could make it bigger with bigger paper.
Post it notes are only a suggestion in this case. Use a larger piece of paper if that suits you better.
Awesome instructable with clear pictures! thanks for posting this! BTW the boxes also scale up quite nicely to different sizes as long as it is a square :)
SMD electronic components ;)
One thing that comes to mind is that this tiny box can hold your limited imagination.
Funny, NYRob! But, not very nice. Remember our rules? Corky.
It's a joke! Don't lose your sense of humor.
Maybe if they just had a very small box to put it in, it wouldn't have gotten lost.
a pretty good joke, too -not to be mean, just pointing it out.
The comment is a general comment not directed to anyone in this politically correct world. Think of the remark in this sense, &quot;One thing that comes to mind is that this tiny box can hold ones limited imagination.&quot;
*The comment is a general comment not directed to anyone in this politically correct world. * You can't backpedal out of snarkiness that easily, NewYorkRob. It wasn't generally directed, it was specific. And it doesn't have anything to do with political correctness (which I abhor). It has everything to do with courtesy.
I have never been so insulted in my life! What an accusation!
What if it was a tiny sketchbook full of schematics, for instance, why not? Write? Even Though it's compartmental imagination eludes its confinement.
Ooookay... asking a genuine question... but if with snark is how you feel you need to respond, more power to you. Hope whoever peed in your cheerios gets what's coming to them.
To be real origami it has to be pure square paper. no cuts. no tears. but besides that I do declare that THIS INSTUCTABLE IS EPIC!
you could put pennys in the box :D.
Cool, kinda tiny but so cool!
You probably weren't expecting anyone to click on that link, but I happen to be quite smarter than a bear, actually almost to the level of a fish, and I clicked on the link but it was a dead link... you filthy liar.
Whoa, why so mean? Just go to his profile and enjoy. o_O.
Make me smarter than the average bear by posting how to make without the cuts.
This box can be made with a $50.00 bill also. Practically any paper currency will work as well.
i did it and it was not easy at first but it's very nice thank you for posting how to make it.
Whoops, I didn't expect it to go to the top. I was speaking of the comment at the bottom of the page.
