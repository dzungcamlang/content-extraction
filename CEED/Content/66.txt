Hope he has success there. Got the shaft here. Not a big Miles fan though by any means.

He's also playing behind a real O line, too. That helps. But, yeah, he has the benefit of real coaching now.

That's what's funny. Most fan bases think they have shitty coaches at some point.

That's pretty funny. 

Etling sets his feet and throws the ball within a zip code of 4/5 star receivers. That's the difference right now between him and Harris

Outside of Alabama and maybe Michigan, I think every fanbase thinks they are 1 HC or coordinator away from a dynasty. Even Vanderbilt.

Biggest thing to me (besides accuracy) he doesn't stare down one receiver. He works through his progressions. He also has a good feel for the pocket collapsing (awareness), which is a gift. Eyes in the back of the head.

Ya it did seem like he "used" the pocket better from what I saw as well

Working thru his progressions is DEFINITELY not something he learn from Miles or Cam. Had to have been taught that some where else.

And the funny thing is if he has any future success here we'll claim that he was "developed" at Purdue and we still can't coach a QB.

Wow, they must be real bad because some of those guys are saying Etling is playing behind a real offensive line- Wrong 

Another said "does Cam want a head coaching job"       :lol: 

Wow, we think we have it bad, not must be a shite show, but I bet their coach is not as hard headed as Miles. No one can possibly be

His pocket presence was one of the most impressive things i saw last night. He seems to be pretty in tune too where the pressure is coming from. Also his decision making under pressure was solid too. There are glimpses there that show he can be a very solid starter IF the offense is called well. That will be Etling's biggest hurdle, not his ability. Not to mention He's not a slouch with his feet either.
