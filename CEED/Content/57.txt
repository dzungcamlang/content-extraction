Are there any third party apps that can measure your heart rate that use the proper sensor on the S7 edge?

All the ones I have seen in the app store use the camera and are rubbish.

I would like to be able to just get a graph of my hear beat over an extended period rather than just see the hear rate as in S-Health.

Is the heart rate sensor on the S7 Edge specific to Samsung or is it built into Android like the fingerprint sensor is now?

I don't know about 3rd party apps, but I just got the new galaxy s7 as well and was trying to find a way to utilize the heart rate sensor and I found this. Hope it helps! 

HRM Sensor: 
The heart rate sensor enables users to monitor their physical information, which can be checked through the S Health app. In addition, the front-facing camera of the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge lets you take selfies using your heart rate monitor sensor.

I hope your are having fun with your new phone. I am still playing with mine like a kid on Christmas morning 

Yeah I know S-Health does it, but was wondering if the sensor uses a standard API in the hope that other apps will make use of it.

Sadly no there isn't no third party app
