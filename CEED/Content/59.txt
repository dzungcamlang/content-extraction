need help with wording to BEC MIL *update pg3, DH's crazy family

in short: my MIL (mother-in-law) is my BEC. she's mostly a lovely woman, very kind, generous and non-boundary stomping. i just find her personally annoying, one of those people that can't stand silence and needs to just constantly be talking to fill the voids, regardless of the topic. it's mundane and boring and constantly makes you want to scream "oh my god, i don't CAAAAARRRE!!" but she's harmless overall.

i can tolerate her for family functions, or when she stops by to see DH (dear husband) and our 11 month DD (dear daughter) (he's a work-at-home dad so is home with DD (dear daughter) while i am at work, and MIL (mother-in-law) comes to visit about once every two weeks or so on average - we live an hour's drive away from her), but i have no interest in spending time with her just the two of us. i don't know that i could keep my composure for any extended period of time.

she was over yesterday so DH (dear husband) could help her with her new phone (she thought it was a good idea to get a smartphone for some reason, even though she's generally technologically inept, kind of dense and has a hard time grasping how this stuff works). it took him all day to get it working in a way she was comfortable with and was still there but about to head out when i got home from work.

my birthday is this coming sunday. DH (dear husband) and i have been together for 9 years, and during those 9 years we always get together with his parents (they are long since divorced but remain good friends) for a special dinner out for all of our birthdays (so mine, DH's, MIL's and FIL's). we said we weren't sure what we were doing as a family, but that we'd be glad to get together for dinner on saturday with them and that i would think of a place i would like to go.

she then went on to tell me directly that i should think of what i would like for my birthday, whatever i want and that she ALSO wants to take me shopping or get mani/pedis or massages or whatever and "just get some girl time."

i vaguely responded in the moment with "i'll think about what i might need or want and will let you know" and managed to bean dip. she left shortly after that.

she's done a lot in helping us out when needed with DD, and like i said has always been very much non-boundary stomping and respectful of our wishes. i've tried to say i don't want anything from her for my birthday as she's already done so much for us over the past year, but she won't hear it and basically insists on getting me something special just for me. i can accept that and can decide on something, but i have zero interest in spending this "quality girl time" with her in addition.

how do i get that message across to her, without coming across that i simply don't want to spend alone time with her? she can be sensitive and shuts down temporarily if she's had her feelings hurt in some way while she processes (like she won't answer her phone for a day or two), and i don't want to create any tension right before my birthday and DD's first birthday and party coming up soon after that as well.

hope this makes sense. i can answer any and all questions. DH (dear husband) is fully aware of my feelings on his mother and completely understands and supports me, but couldn't really come up with a way to word things, either.

i think part of the reason she's my BEC is because she's vaguely aware of what is going on with my FOO (she does NOT know any details beyond my family is a pack of disrespectful assholes and we are not speaking to any of them currently) and thinks i have a "mother" void that needs to be filled. while she doesn't push herself on me in any way and hasn't of course said things like that TO me or even to DH, it's kind of how i interpret her actions sometimes. she doesn't have much of a relationship with either of her daughters and adores me like the daughter she never had (because DH's sisters are awful, awful people that we don't have a relationship with, either, and while i know they learned it from somewhere i really don't think it was from MIL (mother-in-law) - in 9 years she has yet to show any signs of BSC). i have no interest in having this special "mother-daughter" relationship with her, and i don't want to give her any false hope by trying to suck it up for an afternoon or be dishonest.

plus, this "girl's day" she's proposing is not a birthday gift for me. it's a gift for her as well, which i feel should be up to ME to propose, not her.

Tell her a thing that you want for your birthday instead of an activity. Then tell her that the special birthday dinner you have with everyone is enough. 

When she pushes for the girls day, tell her that you appreciate the sentiment but that's not really your thing/you're too busy/you prefer doing something with the whole family instead. Then just say No, thank you, to any further pushing. 

If her feelings get hurt, that's her issue to deal with, not yours.

i know ultimately there's only so much i can do in trying to not hurt her feelings, and if they get hurt regardless then that's on her. i'm just trying to spare her as much as i can because i don't feel at all like she "deserves" to have her feelings hurt, if that makes sense at all.

Just tell her that as a working mom you would rather spend your free time with your baby than a girls day out.

I don't understand why you have to spend your birthday with the PILs

it's never on the actual birthday - that has always been reserved for the birthday person to spend however they would like, of course. the day OF my birthday i'll be spending it with my nuclear family.

we've just always done the dinner thing, whether it be out at a restaurant or someone cooks a special meal, on a day close to it. it's always been an enjoyable time (i get along better with FIL (father-in-law) and enjoy his company, and when DH's uncle was still alive he would come along as well and we ADORED him) and it's never been an issue.

we certainly don't have to - we've just never had a reason or want to not do it.

This is a great answer for when she asks. 
OP, you need ducks in rows because right now you have squirrels at a rave.

What about, "The free time I do get, I would like to just spend with my DD. As a working mom I don't feel that I get enough time with just her, so thank you for the offer but I'm afraid I will be busy and not able to attend."

Or, "MIL, Thank you for your offer but I like the relationship we have right now, I don't think outtings are necessary. We will see you soon at X event!"

I'm normally scorched earth type of person and I don't really think it's appropriate here, but I do want to point one thing out. I'm seeing a waving pink flag with the issues in reguards to your FOO and MIL (mother-in-law) trying to do outtings. You said you even feel that MIL (mother-in-law) *thinks* you have some kind of Mom void because your FOO isn't on speaking terms right now, just be cautious here. I'm not sure why it is sticking with me and they aren't bright red flags or anything, but something does seem a little off about.

i really like this response - it's kind yet to the point and doesn't leave much open to interpretation. thank you so much!

also, i see where you're coming from with the pink flag and her trying to fill some imagined void. it seems a little off to me as well, which is why i pointed it out, but not in any sort of an alarming way. i just try to be aware of her actions and do what i can to not allow her to see some kind of a wanting on my end. i have all the emotional support that i need between my therapist, my DH, my DD (dear daughter) and my friends.

i don't think she'll ever really cross a line or anything - she has such a rocky relationship with her daughters and other two granddaughters (which was due to no fault on her part) that she cautiously watches all of her steps with me and DH (dear husband) to make sure she doesn't cross a boundary or do anything to upset us. even though the other two were not at all because of anything she did, i think a part of her still thinks she did something wrong somewhere.

i sometimes wonder if she does have a "grandma experience" expectation in her head (she's never, ever said anything of the sort, though). DH (dear husband) grew up just a few doors down from his grandmother (FIL's mother) and spent a LOT of time with her when he was growing up. the difference between her and his mother, however, is that his grandma was very intelligent and cultured (along with his uncle who lived with her as well), so he was able to learn an awful lot from them and his life was very enriched by having them in it so fully. his mom, on the other hand, while kind and loving, doesn't really bring a whole lot else to the table. while i would never think of denying her a relationship with DD, i don't think it will be nearly as involved as DH's was with his grandma. i just wonder sometimes if she's expecting that since that's how it happened with her kids.
