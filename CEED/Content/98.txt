He’s at it again. As I write this, he’s ranting about African Americans, asking “what the hell do you have to lose?” again. He clearly thinks this is a great, winning line.

And have a look at the audience to whom he’s making this “appeal to African Americans.”

He’s back to the wall and all his usual shtick.

I guess he is signaling to his new crew, especially Kellyanne Conway, he is still in charge. He can’t be having people in the media speculating the new staff is making him change, pivot whatever. That would make him look weak and not in control.

He is going to drive this campaign over the cliff himself.

I wonder, how long before we have another campaign staff shakeup. Sure it would be a bad signal and unprecedented…but this is TRUMP®.

I’m honestly amazed by what the electoral college map looks like this year. Going by 538’s polls-only projections, Arizona and Georgia are coin flips. Clinton’s chances in Missouri and South BY GAWD Cara-WHOOOOO-lina (/Ric Flair) are basically the same as having a flush draw with two cards to come in hold ‘em. And she’s looking at a gut shot straight draw in Utah of all places. Two years ago, I could not have imagined a scenario where those five states were that close.

Trump’s Downfall bunker scene is going to be epic.

That’s a very strange thing for Trump to say. Why admit that anything in the Clinton ads is “not phony”? The fact that the Clinton ads (I assume) are mainly based on recordings of Trump himself is surely not an obstacle to fact-averse Republicans.

There will be no dialing back of the intensity of this election between now and November. It’s going to be incredibly nerve-wracking, but hopefully a good thing if the end result is a clear referendum on blatant racism in America with a sufficiently decisive anti-GOP result.

Presidency, Senate and House for the Democrats would be a good start. The GOP as a party is not qualified to hold any public office anywhere in the US at any level, down to county commissioners for counties with less than 100 inhabitants.

This is truly a time when the media’s chief task, namely selling advertising time to client to generate earnings for their parent companies, clashes with its ostensible task of keeping Americans informed.

Reason number 11,345 why the “media” hates Aaron Sorkin and hated Newsroom (I’ve been re-watching it and enjoying it as much the second time around as the first). From season 1, episode 3, the Will McAvoy character opens his newscast with:

In the infancy of mass communications, the Columbus and Magellan of broadcast journalism, William Paley and David Sarnoff, went down to Washington to cut a deal with Congress.

Congress would allow the fledgling networks free use of taxpayer-owned airwaves in exchange for one public service.

That public service would be one hour of air time set aside every night for informational broadcasting, or what we now call the evening news.

Congress, unable to anticipate the enormous capacity television would have to deliver consumers to advertisers, failed to include in its deal the one requirement that would have changed our national discourse immeasurably for the better. Congress forgot to add that under no circumstances could there be paid advertising during informational broadcasting.

They forgot to say that taxpayers will give you the airwaves for free and for 23 hours a day you should make a profit, but for one hour a night you work for us.

And now those network newscasts… have to compete with the likes of me.

And, of course, word that Trump’s web designer/$8 million ad guy is a dirtball:

Turns out the web designer has been leveraging the Trump Campaigns website to usurp other web designers in the San Antonio area by hiding links in his clients’ webpages (big no no for google because they can contain malware and are generally considered spam):

So basically there are a set of tactics that Google has said it does not condone, and it will punish companies for engaging in them. Basically Parscale is deep in these proscribed tactics for his own web development business. Generally considered very shady in the digital marketing space.

That’s not the correct way to think about it. The gerrymander of 2010 is precisely what might put a large number of house seats in play this election, with Trump at the top of the ticket bringing unplanned levels of destruction to GOP down ticket races.

And that’s how they win. The correct emotion for this is anger, not nervousness, or fear.

I am not afraid, just nervous. I have the means to protect my family if it all goes tits-up, and I live in a little blue pimple here in Texas. I’m nervous about my *country*, not my neighborhood. And yes, I’m angry that a pack of yahoos have taken over a major political party and the “adults” who purportedly lead them are falling into line behind The Toxic Cheetoh Shit Gibbon.

That’s not the correct way to think about it. The gerrymander of 2010 is precisely what might put a large number of house seats in play this election, with Trump at the top of the ticket bringing unplanned levels of destruction to GOP down ticket races.

I disagree based on the demographics in those Districts- they didn’t go halfway, they went full segregation. But we’ll just have to see.

However, an effective Republican gerrymander will create a large number of R districts that are just safe enough for the Rs and a small number of districts that are very safe for the Democrats. This is because the whole point of the gerrymander is to create more districts for the Republicans than they really ought to have.

By its inherent nature, such a gerrymander is vulnerable to a mass reversal if there is some kind of GOP disaster (like nominating the vulgar talking yam).

If he and Pence think they’re “reaching out” to me by posting pics of them eating fried chicken on Twitter, they’re SOL because I don’t eat fried chicken. I don’t cook it, and I don’t order it when I’m in a mood to consume fast food. If only people like them were more aware, they’d know that many of us have modified our eating habits over the years in order to avoid obesity, diabetes, heart disease, and high blood pressure, major killers of persons in our demographic.

The so-called hard working businessman is a spoiled lazy brat. Travelling and actually reading speeches rather than just bullshitting for an hour is just too much work.

Trump talks tough, but since the media stopped fawning over him and started asking questions, he’s avoided all networks but Fox. And his continuing attacks and condemnation of the media combined with his cowardice makes it unlikely he’ll make appearances anywhere but Fox, where the “interviews” are basically Trump commercials.

The irony is that he was able to run a cheap primary campaign because of all the media attention and he seems to be using the same strategy for the general election. But now that he’s avoiding all media but Fox, he’s limited to preaching to the choir at Fox’s audience. Since he’s spent almost nothing on ads and GOTV efforts, limiting his TV campaigning to his base seems foolhardy.

But then, it is Trump.

Trump is a reflection of his base. Any reasonable, intelligent person would be learning the essentials about the economy, foreign policy, the responsibilities of the executive branch and its powers, etc. in preparation for the debates and the possibility of winning the election.

But Trump is lazy and running in a party where ignorance is a virtue and facts are determined by dogma rather than reality. So we could end up with a President who believes silly conspiracy theories while declaring the intelligence services idiots unworthy of consulting. Who, if unrestrained, would order war crimes and even use of nuclear weapons.

California said “a plague on both your houses” a few years ago, and gave control to a Citizen’s committee. So we have rationally drawn “purple” districts — as purple as is possible in a bright-blue state.

Of course, the committee is new, and hasn’t had time to be corrupted yet. (What me cynical? Moi?)

And California has another key reform; multiparty primaries, to prevent a tiny sliver of party activists from electing extreme candidates.

The copy for an attack ad based on this practically writes itself.

“Trump was already paying his own company tens of thousands of dollars from his campaign, which was shady enough. But when the large donations started rolling in, he jacked up the price over five times… even though he reduced the size of his staff working in Trump Tower.

If Trump is willing to fleece his own donors this way… what do you think he’ll do to the American taxpayer?”
