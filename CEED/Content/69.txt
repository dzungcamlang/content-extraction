G&G TEINT LIGHTENING BEAUTY CRÃˆME (Pink)
Testimony to share - I got 3 jars of this cream for my Daughter (19) back in February and now she's gone 3 to 4 shades lighter all over, everyone keeps asking her what she's using. She's done some modelling job in the interim and her regime is just to use retin a 0.05% cream on her face and dark stubborn areas and she looks really good, I just can't believe it.

Yes, I'm in the UK so I could only get the 200g jar. She's on her 3rd jar now and its so nice, you can hardly get the pink jar cream now all I see in the market is the red jar cream. This cream works wonders and I'm so tempted to try it just like her but I'm using the Kligman's method now and so confused - It doesn't help if you see the testimony every single day...lol

that's kind of weird...why not have sent her the kligman's formula instead? or if the g&g works great for her that encouraged you to send it to her, how did you know it worked so great if you never tried it before? it say bearberry and kojic acid..i never known of these 2 to be such powerful lightening ingredients, bearberry is rather mild and ka would have to be used at significant amounts in order to provide dramatic results on it's own but the increase of irritation is more likely....there must be something else in there like hq (which is fine) or something else if it can push 3-4 shades in like 4 - 4.5 months? I'm just a little curious..physically seeing the results that have been seen helps some (identity can be hidden though for privacy).

A bit confused here, I'm talking about my daughter and I bought the cream for her back in February and I'm using the kligman's formula. I can see her dramatic result because of retin a. Sorry can't post my daughters pictures but will see what I can do to edit her face and all and post it so you can see

Could you please post all the ingredients in the cream. It should be on the jar. On their website it only states bearberry n kojic acid. Thank you.
