Default Will the epson WorkForce 1100 for for dye sublimation?
Epson WorkForce 1100 Wide-format Printer, Overview - Product Information - Epson America, Inc.

I was just wondering if anyone has checked this one out yet. I haven't seen any talk about it yet on these forums.

It seems nice because of the fact its larger format and you use less cartridges. I would think it will be a popular item in the future when they start making sub stuff for them.

It use 4 carts w/ an extra black which is a total of 5 cartridges.

Inkjetcarts.us says that is the best cost-effective printer for heat transfer and sublimation because it only uses 4 ink cartridges and already uses pigment inks so no icc needed.

Ahh so they are already making sublimation stuff for it.

I wonder if this printer is designed any different than the other models. Its less than a 1400 I wonder if its lower just becuase of one less ink cart, less stuff to manufacturer?

It is a wide-format printer, cheaper than the 1400, and uses less cartridges so it may be more convenient and cost-effective to use.

Default Re: WorkForce 1100
can this be used to print on film transparencies for silk screen printing? Since there are only cartridges would that compromise the ability to get dark prints needed for the films? id think it wouldnt since its missing only the Light CYMK colors but I would like to know if anyone has used this printer in this way before. Its the cheapest wide format epson i know of.

In the UK this printer retails at 199 pounds as opposed to 149 US Dollars ( including rebate ),
Just another example of the cost difference in the UK

New to sublimation, I am looking for sublimation inks for the Epson Workforce 1100. Sawgrass does not have anything available yet. I see it takes the same oem cartridges as the C120. Does anyone know if I can use the quick connect bulk ink system or cartridges made for the C120 with this printer?

Sawgrass do not support the 1100 printer the only way to use it for sublimation is purchase a Ciss for it InkJetCarts sell them and use Chinese inks.
I use the 1100 with I-trans transfer paper and use InkJetCarts fabric ink for doing 100% cotton or whatever fabric that will withstand the 200c heatpress with great results with this setup you can't ust it for hard substrates eg. cooffee mugs etc.

The C120 carts., are not suitable for the 1100 I have tried them only the black ink carts work in it the colours are not the same chipset but like i said in previous post you can get the correct carts or ciss system with the correct chipset.
