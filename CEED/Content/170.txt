    Heâs a tattooed, rock-hard bad-boy with a bad attitude to match. But heâs got his reasons. His mother died when Pax was seven, leaving a hole in his heart filled with guilt although he doesnât understand why. What he does know is that he and his dad are left alone and with more issues than they can count. As Pax grew up, he tried to be the kid his father always wanted; the perfect golden boy, but it didnât work. His dad couldnât overcome his grief long enough to notice and Pax couldnât keep up the impossible perfect faÃ§ade. So he slipped far, far from it. Now, he uses drugs and women to cope with the ugliness, the black void that he doesnât want to deal with. If he pretends that the emptiness isnât there, then it isnât, right? Wrong. And itâs never more apparent than when he meets Mila. Sweet, beautiful Mila Hill is the fresh air to his hardened frown, the beauty to his ugly heart. He doesnât know how to not hurt her, but he quickly realizes that heâs got to figure it out because he needs her to breathe. When memories of his motherâs death resurface from where heâs repressed them for so long, Mila is there to catch him when the guilt starts making sense. Mila is the oneâ¦the one who can save him from his broken troubled heart; from his issues, from the emptiness. But only if he can stop being an asshole long enough to allow it. He knows that. And heâs working on it.

	Beautifully Broken #2.5: Until We Burn
    As a 24-year old actor with the world on a string, not many women tell Dominic no. In a life where no doesnât exist, he stretches the boundaries between what is right, what is wrong and what is downright depraved. Dark and damaged, Dom wants no commitments. He wants no attachments. He only wants to disappear into the taboo, into a place where he feels something. Anything. But when the aching need to disappear into the darkness is the only thing he has left, Dominic flounders. In a world that is hollow and sexual, without a guiding light or a reason to breathe, Dominic is lost and broken. He knows heâll never be fixed. So he makes a decision. If heâs going to hell, he might as well make it worth it.

He doesn't care about much of anything, except for losing himself in the roles that he plays. 23-year old Jacey Vincent doesn't realize how much her father's indifference has affected her. She is proof that sometimes it isn't one specific moment that wrecks a person, but rather it's an absence of moments. She's like a bird with a broken wing-strong yet fragile, as she tries to float through life, finding acceptance in the arms of random guys, one after the other... to fill the void that her father left in her. Until she meets Dominic.
