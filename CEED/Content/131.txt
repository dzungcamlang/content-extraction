Warm the milk and water in a small saucepan until very warm (125 degrees F/50 degrees C). Lightly grease two 8x4 inch loaf pans; sprinkle cornmeal inside pans.
In a large bowl, mix together 3 cups flour, yeast, sugar, salt and soda. Stir milk into the flour mixture; beat well. Stir in the remaining flour, 1 cup at a time, until a stiff batter is formed. Spoon batter into prepared pans. Cover and let rise in a warm place for until nearly doubled in size, about 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
Bake in preheated oven until golden brown, about 25 minutes. Remove from pans immediately and cool.

This recipe is a nice "starting off point" but personally I think 1/4 teaspoon baking soda for two loaves is not enough.... I put 1/2 teaspoon for two loaves and also the "batter" came out dry.....
