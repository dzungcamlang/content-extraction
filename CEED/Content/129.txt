Usage Notes.
Despite claims that anticipate should only be used to mean “to perform (an action) or respond to (a question, etc.) in advance” or “to forestall,” it has been used widely since the 18th century as a synonym for expect, often with an implication of pleasure:  We anticipate a large turnout at the next meeting.  This use is standard in all types of speech and writing.

Word Origin & History.
anticipate 1530s, "to cause to happen sooner," from L. anticipatus, pp. of anticipare "take (care of) ahead of time," lit. "taking into possession beforehand," from ante "before" (see ante) + capere "to take" (see capable). Later "to be aware of (something) coming at a future time" (1640s). Used in the sense of "expect, look forward to" since 1749, but anticipate has an element of "prepare for, forestall" that should prevent its being used as a synonym for expect. Related: Anticipatory (1660s).
