Looking for pics of G37x sedan with 19inch OEM wheels (but no drop) and advice
Hey guys, 

I'm a newbie when it comes to wheels, so I apologize in advance for what many may think are simple questions. I have a 2009 G37x sedan and lately have been thinking about changing from the stock 17 inch wheels to the 19 inch coupe wheels. I've done quite a bit of forum searching and I know I will need to use 4 front coupe wheels to work with the AWD system. I was wondering if anyone has done this without dropping the car, if so can you please post up a pic? I did a ton of searching and I've found numerous pics of G37xS and G37 sedans with this setup that all look nice, but I couldn't find any pics of the G37x. I've heard the AWD sits higher so I'm not sure if it will look ok or not without a drop.

Also if I do go ahead with this, I'm assuming I will need to buy new tires for the wheels - I can't put my stock ones on the new wheels, right? What about TPMS and valve stems? Am I able to move them from stock wheels and put them on new wheels? Can I also move the center cap from stock wheel to the coupe ones (or would they be different size?)

Lastly my plan for all this is as follows: In order to get 4 front coupe wheels, it seems the easiest way (and to make sure that I'm not buying stolen wheels) would be to find a dealer and get it from them. I found Sewell Infiniti's website will sell the front 19x8 wheel for ~$560 each, so I guess I would buy 4 of them. Then I would need to buy new tires (will need all season ones as I live in Ohio). Lastly I would need to locate a shop to do all the wheel and tire changing. Will they need to be balanced, etc... as well?

I'm estimating cost of ~$3-3.5K for this - does that sound about right? After this is completed, I would then be free to sell my current stock wheels. They are in excellent condition and have never seen snow or ice. Do you think I would be able to get $6-700 for them? So maybe my total overall cost would reasonably be ~$3K. What do you guys think? Since I'm new to all this, I just want to make sure I've considered everything before making any decisions. Thanks in advance to all who can help me out!

You actually can use staggered wheels on the x. you dont have to use all fronts or all rears. I think the general rule is the different widths dont matter, as lond as the overall diameter of the wheels is close to them same, with .3 inches. I believe the sport wheels stock tires are .25 difference from one another. I would strongly recommend finding a complete set of wheels and tires somewhere. You wont pay more than 1,600 for a clean set with tires. When you get the wheels put on, the shop can transfer your TPMS over to the new wheels. They should be balanced again, especially if you install you TPMS. You should be able to sell your stock wheels for $700 if they are as you described them.

Here is a picture of a stock sedan with the sport 19's and no drop. I'm not sure if its a X though, but it'll give you an idea.

19inch wheels and tires should cost you no more than 16-1700. center caps are the same, yes u can switch them if the wheels do not come with caps. no u cant use the oem tires because of different rim size. therefore, get a new set of tires to be installed, and during installation ask them to transfer the tpms. 

Many guys on the forum are always selling stock 19s. I got my four front from guys on this forum. I purchased all four rims and used tires for 1100. although i purchased mine two fronts at a time.

Sewell offers discounts for members of G35driver. If you're not a member of G35driver, then go ahead and sign up. Then go to the Sewell site and register with them. They'll ask if you're a member of a forum. Once registered, you'll see the forum prices on all their parts. 

I've been thinking about doing this as well. Does anyone know if the stock 18" lug nuts fit the 19s?

That looks so good with the wheels and chin spoiler. Drop might help, but it doesn't look bad at all.

Not sure how far IL is from where you are, but you might want to look into these.

Thanks for all the input everyone! 

cdso - thanks for tip on Sewell Infiniti. With G35 discount, wheels are $480 each (instead of $560). I'm thinking maybe I'll buy 2 used front wheels that are in very good condition from the forums here, and then also buy 2 new front ones from Sewell so I can have my set of four.

Does anyone have any recommendations on decent all season tires to put on these wheels? I've seen that many people have recommended Blizzak tires on this website - will those be OK for this type of setup (G37x sedan with 19 inch coupe wheels)?

One thing I did notice while searching around, I saw those Vossen CV1s. Man they are nice but are only in 20 inch size (which I think might affect the quality of ride). Has anyone had any experience with this wheel on a sedan? Any issues? I suspect I will probably just stick with the OEM coupe wheels, but man those Vossens are tight!

Thanks guys!

I know you asked for AWD sedan on OEM wheels. However, it doesn't look that much different from my RWD Journey on OEM Sport Coupe wheels. It might sit an inch higher. My car is not lowered. IMHO get a used set. Plenty of OEM wheels here for sale. You can get some really nice aftermarket wheels with $3K and lower your ride or do other mods. I personally wouldn't pay over $1700 for OEM wheels. As others stated TPMS and center caps are interchangeable. You might have to reprogram TPMS once they are swapped out.

I think I saw you on the 2 south this morning by eagle rock.

I would love to get the CV1s, but I think if you get 20s, you need to be pretty slammed for it to look right. Looks great on the coupe esp with the forward stance.

I was considering the Continental DWS but I read the sidewall is pretty soft. I'll probably end up getting the Yokohama Avids. Good all season tire and reasonable price. With awd I'm not sure you need a winter tire unless you drive through a lot of snow.
