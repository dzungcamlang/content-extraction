14 weeks and gained 1lb. I have no idea how though. I've been stuffing my face with all sorts of unhealthy foods. I was shocked.

Almost 13 weeks and I've lost 4-5 lbs. but I was 9 lbs overweight (from last nov 15 baby).
I hope to loose more before I start gaining but really don't prefer puking. So.. Idk. Whatever. Lol

14 weeks and pretty sure I'm up ohhhhhhh 14 lbs. Don't judge me. I'm an overachiever.

If I agreed with you, we'd both be wrong.

12 weeks and last i checked i was down 12 lbs. Which puts me borderline underweight. This has not been a healthy pregnancy so far.
