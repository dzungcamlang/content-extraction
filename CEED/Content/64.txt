While we are killing time hitting refresh, I don't think this has been asked yet, but what is everyone upgrading *from*? Also, put in what you are upgrading to, for reference. I will start it off:

128GB iPhone 6 Silver -> 256GB iPhone 7 Silver

Edit: Don't shun me for not getting a plus! I went back and forth, and still kind of want one, but worried about one-handed use.
gold iphone 6+, 64gb...i'm excited for rose gold and the new features that 6S got and i didn't :)

I get a little sad inside when everyone starts posting their phones on launch day and then slowly start signing off until next year. Very sappy, I know lol.
I feel the same way: we're in this together and kind of get to know one another in a small way. I'm surprised that I didn't see very many riding in on their high horse to throw out their wet blankets of "it's a phone, people", "if only you were as concerned about world hunger as you are about a stupid phone", etc (a few, but not as many as prior years)...very refreshing. Starting tomorrow, we can all look forward to the "****-gate" posts. :)

Tomorrow I will have an iPhone 7+ gold 128GB. Upgrading from a 6+ 56GB. I hope I will sleep tonight.

It happens to me on every UPS delivery.JAX is a big hub in FL.
From flightaware.com, it appears both MCO and JAX are UPS hubs, with both having multiple flights daily. To me, MCO makes much more sense for both of us.

Touchdown in Louisville is roughly 1:40AM EST. To my Southern Californians, the next flights to Ontario are either 2:52AM EST or 3:43AM EST, 3:37AM/4:28AM PST arrival time. Then unload and on to the trucks to our local hubs. For me, Anaheim is my local hub, which is about an hour drive WITHOUT traffic. I hope it's on the delivery truck before 7AM, that is the usual time they are loaded up for the day around here.

Just received an arrival from Louisville, KY to Sylmar, CA. Can't believe this was in China just two days ago. Fingers crossed for an early delivery tomorrow ^__^
