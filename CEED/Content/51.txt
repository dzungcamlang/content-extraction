No. They are very different and the prescribing physician should know this as well as whether they should be taken together or not. Hope this helps.

Yes they are... Buspirone and Xanax are in the same class and have the same effect. Buspirone are considered to be the generic of Xanax to by most for physicians.. Because most insurances won't cover the same the name brand Xanax, but will cover Buspirone.. They do the same thing and have the same effect

Xanax and Buspar may be in the same drug class called Benzodiazepones but Xanax is controlled and Buspar is not. Also, I have found that Buspar is not as strong. It is very helpful in treating symptoms associated with anxiety.

Buspar is a non-narcotic anti-anxiety medication.
Clonazepam is a long acting anti-anxiety that is a benzodiazapine. It is a very long acting med and is used extensively in psychiatry for anxiety and panic attacks. Xanax is another benzodiazapine that is very short acting, and does treat anxiety. I, personally, don't think the Buspirone works as well as the benzos. But everyone is different and react to meds in their own unique manner. Talk to your Psychiatrist about what's best for you. In all matters of the mind, some meds work, some don't. It's a coin toss.
Good luck to you...

I had taken Buspar many years ago. I had the one that divides and does look a lot like Xanax (bars or sticks) as they call them on the streets(2mg). I was prescribed Buspar even though I really wanted a Benzodiazapine ie: Valium, clonazepam or xanax for my Panic Disorder. I regreted taking the Buspar for it was way too expensive back in 1999. I had to stop for I had no Health coverage for Prescription of Health care. I went through sheer hell. I felt like my head was on fire, and laying down made it worst. I couldn't sleep, and if I was lucky enough to sleep, "my head on fire "" feeling was worst and 5 minutes of sleep would have strange nightmares which is common for most Withdrawls, especailly Anti-Depressant.

Sorry you just got screwed. No the buspar is not going to help ... find a liberal doctor... get honest and get your own script. Anyone that tells you its the same is full of it.

I take both medications. BuSpar is for anxiety maintenance and long-term use, whereas Xanax is intended for breakthrough anxiety and/or short-term use. This is best discussed with your pharmacist as they know the most about medications. And understand, not all medications work the same in every person. Some may cause horrible side effects while others may have no effect at all. Talk to your doctor AND your pharmacist, please. 
Good luck,

Same. I take both as well. I take the Buspar 3x a day, and the Xanax as needed. I actually got prescribed buspar, so I could cut down on my Xanax. I started recently and have been having good results. I believe my last prescription was $30 for a 30 day supply of genetic Buspirone from CVS. Like another person said, do not stop taking suddenly. Literature about Buspar says you should ween off of it slowly.

Buspar is not in the same class as Xanax nor is it a Narcotic.

Some say they are related and some say they aren't. I don't know who to believe. Are they or aren't they related. Do they work together or not? I'm more confused then ever.

Hi Mwozztswtf:
Please disregard the comment given by the poster by the name of "PIllhelper".
That is the most inaccurate information I have ever read on this site! (And I don't mind saying so!)
The benzodiazepines, by generic names, are: clonazepam , lorazepam, alprazolam. The brand name equivalents of these are: klonopin, ativan, and xanax. These benzodiazepines have a tendency towards being addictive, so many doctors will only prescribe them short term or in small doses for anxiety.
These are considered "rescue meds" so they work relatively fast, so they can be taken as needed.
Buspar is not in this class at all. It is also prescribed for anxiety, but it doesn't work at all the same as the benzos do. It is a safe med that can be taken long-term for anxiety. It is NOT addictive. It is different in the fact that it has to be taken every day in the same doses, much like an antidepressant.

You can also go to the top of this page and click on "DRUGS A-Z". You can type in the names of these medications and it will give you a good description of their uses and side effects. It is very informative and accurate. Good luck!

Why do peeps keep thinking Buspar has ANYTHING to do with Xanax??? Read G's post, which is the most proficient explanation of benzodiazepines I've seen here.

'Sup Meggie! Thanks for that. I just wish people would do their homework before they decide to print inaccurate information on such a serious subject as these types of medications. Know what you are talking about before you put it in print, people, for the sake of those who come here needing accurate advice! Just click on drugs.com and go to drugs A-Z and try to learn something! They give a wealth of valuable information.
