We can only hope it isn't serious. How many players is this going to happen too? Boozer, Irving, Amile, Kelly,

I'm sure Seth Greenburg was touching himself while tweeting that.

No! Probably not serious if he's tweeting about it... I hope not anyway

 

ETA: is 60-70 NBA personnel a lot?

Praying it's not the 5th metatarsil bone aka the worst foot injury possible with no timetable for a return. I don't understand how we seem to have foot injuries so often - Boozer, Ryan Kelly, Kyrie, Amile, now Tatum.

I guess we shouldn't jump to conclusions but with our recent history... maybe we should expect the worst. confused

Mark Armstrong ‏@ArmstrongABC11    3m 3 minutes ago
Mark Armstrong Retweeted Seth Greenberg
Duke tells me: "I guess Seth knows something we don't."

The Duke medical center is going to wind up with more lottery picks than any other team in the country.

I just went from feeling physically sick to wanting to beat the crap out of Greenberg to wondering what the heck is going on.

Has to be good news that Duke is saying it isn't true . Could be a rolled ankle or something , really hope we get an official update ASAP

Hopefully it's no worse than a rolled ankle.

So far Greenberg's tweet is the only one reporting this. Everybody else is just referencing him.
