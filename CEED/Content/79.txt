Transmission Jolt problem
I've had my 2008 Mazda 3 for about 2 years now. I drive A LOT! It had 3900 miles on it when I purchased it in July 2008 and now has about 49000 miles on it. 

It's also had quite a few problems that were covered under warranty including suspension problems, a leaking motor mount, and my thermostat had to be replaced after less than 10000 miles. 

It's most recent problem is this: 
When accelerating (typically onto the highway or something of that nature), the vehicle is jolting when shifting from 3rd to 4th. [It's an automatic]. It typically happens between about 3000 and 4500 RPMs. If I can get it about 4500 RPMs just b.s-ing around, it will not jolt. Also, it doesn't always jolt between those RPMS. So the behavior is random. This is not happening when shifting between other gears. And we're not just talking a jolt because it's shifting at a higher RPM, I'm talking you can feel the entire car shake and jolt, passengers are wondering what the hell kind of thing just happened. -- Mazda has informed me that this problem is normal because it's typical for a vehicle to shift harder at higher RPMs. I'm not buying that. I'm wondering why it's not doing it consistently at the same RPM between 3rd and 4th. And why it's not doing it between other gears, when shifting at even higher RPMs. I've taken it to a transmission specialist and they think there is an internal problem with my transmission. 
It feels as though I'm driving with a person learning to drive a manual.

Has anyone else had this problem? Is it truly something that's normal??

Appreciate the help!

Re: Transmission Jolt problem
Take it to another dealership, also have you had the automatic transmission fluid changed yet? Lastly if they tell you this is normal, look at the guy right in his eyes and say: Ive driven this car every day for 2 years, I think I know how its supposed to shift.

Re: Transmission Jolt problem
Yeah, had the transmission flushed in June. 

I've thought about taking it to another dealer but I hate the dealers here in my hometown. I've told Mazda that I know it's not a characteristic my car has picked up -- as they told me it was. They're still insisting it's normal. They said they would have a mazda engineer come out to take a look at it -- I've made the request for that to happen. But it could take months. 


Any other suggestions? Is this really abnormal? Anyone else had this problem or another problem similar to this?

Re: Transmission Jolt problem
Yes, I have the same exact problem where it thuds from 3rd-4th.

Questions:

Is it a 5spd or 4spd auto?

Does this usually only happen after long drives (transmission is pretty warm), or always?

Who did your transmission flush? If it wasn't the dealer, this could be a problem. We need to know the exact fluid they used.

Have you checked the fluid level? It could just be low. We have a tranny fluid dipstick in our cars under the hood.

Do you experience other symptoms? (tranny slipping, etc)


It is more than likely the tranny is slowly on its way out. I have been through a few auto's on previous cars and I'll tell you a transmission thud is not good.

Re: Transmission Jolt problem
Hey, 

My car is a 5 speed automatic. It does it regardless of whether the car is warm or cold. 

The mazda dealership did my transmission flush. As soon as I left the dealer it jolted when I got on the highway a mile up the road. So I doubt it's due to fluid level. 

It's not feeling like it's slipping. Occasionally, when you accelerate, it will shift down quickly and then back up quickly (and i mean really quickly) and the car will jolt pretty bad. But it's only happened a few times. 

Thanks for your help!

I wish if the tranny was going to go that it would just go so that mazda quits giving me the run around!! :x

The shifting down and up isn't a great sign.. the Torque Converter may be going out which is an internal part of the transmission. Which means you will need a tranny rebuild at the very least which is very very costly.

They're probably jsut trying to dick you around until your car is out of warranty (60,000 miles/3 yrs for drivetrain warranty). Don't let them push you around; bug the hell out of them lol. Get your money's worth because if you have to pay for it out of your pocket it sucks ass. I've been there... $3500 down the drain.

In the mean time, take the car to a local transmission shop and get an official inspection to see what they think. If they think it needs a rebuild then insist on the dealership fixing it.

One thing that could be making your tranny act up is when you had the fluid changed. You had it done close to 50k miles which is almost considered a high mileage automatic transmission fluid change. and those can be 50/50 as in they will ruin your tranny or make it better. if you do automatic fluid changes, they're supposed to be done around every 30k miles from the beginning, doing one late in the game can be bad. this is because the tranny is used to the really old dirty sludgy fluid that has built onto the transmission, which allows it to grip correctly. new fluid messes with the friction of the old bad fluid and causes the tranmission to slip and do weird things. think of it as the tranny is used to gripping rough sandpaper (old fluid) and now you have really smooth sandpaper (new fluid) so now it doesn't grip. not good.

one thing you should when you get a chance is drain some tranny fluid like you would an oil change. 3-4 quarts should come out. look for metal shavings, if you see any, the tranny is screwed. then put 3-4 quarts of new fluid in.

another thing you should do is ask what the exact fluid is they used. it must be something M-V complaint (not Mercon V, that is different from M-V). and none of that dextron III shit with a mercon v or M-V additive. I doubt they would screw up there but you never know.

I hate Autotragics so much grrrrr

hope that helps lol let me know!

Re: Transmission Jolt problem
look on your receipt from the dealer and find the part # for the ATX fluid they used. Then call a dealer and find out the specs for that part # and see if it is the correct atx fluid. I had a Mazda dealer change the atx fluid in my wifes' Mazda 6 and went on the assumption they would use the correct fluid for that car (V6/5 sp ATX), guess what. The dealer just used what they had in stock, NOT the correct fluid, so I made them change/flush it twice with the right stuff to give some assurance the wrong fluid was pretty cleaned out. They were not happy but I was even more unhappy, had to talk to the GM at this dealer, needless to say, didn't use that dealer anymore and learned to check/verify the part #'s for the correct stuff going forward.
Life is not a box of chocolates. It's more like a jar of jalapenos, what you do today may burn you tomorrow.

Re: Transmission Jolt problem
I have the same issue of the jolting from 3rd to 4th, but that's only at high rpm's. What I have in addition to that is a very violent downshift from 3rd to 2nd when I step on it.

Re: Transmission Jolt problem
And it's official...

Took my car to the dealership to be test driven again on Thursday and they've ordered a transmission for it. -- Under warranty of course. 

The technician who drove my vehicle with me said they have seen this a lot. He had another customer the day before I was there who was having a jolt from 3rd to 4th at higher rpms. That's how mine had started and now it's getting worse. 

Glad it's taken care of and my 3 will be getting a transmission. But sucks that my car has to have a new transmission after less than 50K miles. 

Thanks for the help guys! Good luck to those of you having the same problem!
