Amy Schumer & Goldie Hawn release 'Formation' parody on Tidal
Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn Star in Beyoncé ‘Formation’ Parody Video — Watch

The video, entitled “Get in Formation,” features Schumer lip-syncing to Beyoncé and performing a similarly provocative dance routine

It would appear that Amy Schumer was thirsty for her own version of Beyoncé’s “Lemonade.” Schumer and Goldie Hawn have released a new video parodying “Lemonade’s” closing song “Formation,” Pitchfork reports.
The video, entitled “Get in Formation,” features Schumer and Hawn lip-syncing to Beyoncé’s “Formation” and performing a similarly provocative dance routine, though comparison of the pair’s moves to Beyoncés is probably a bit of a stretch. “Get in Formation,” which includes farm animals and a Chihuahua, is not the first “Formation” parody video, as Jimmy Kimmel and James Corden have also done similar versions. Schumer’s video is also reminiscent of Aziz Ansari and Eric Wareheim’s parody of Kanye West’s “Famous.”
To watch Schumer’s parody of “Formation,” check out the video below.

What's the point if she didn't add anything? And I find it funny that her fans can't believe people might not like her for other reasons than misogyny and patriarchy or other big words they use for no reason when she's just not funny. To me.

Omg! My mouth was agape in shock! I can't believe she even had one thought in her head telling her this is a good idea!

It was really awkward to watch. :/
A man who flashes you his penis is a fucking pervert, but if a woman does it, she is liberating herself? Why, because men profit/are stimulated on it? This faux feminist movement is so backwards.

I'm too drunk to watch it, but it gives me an excuse to use one of my favorite gif that I don't often get to use...

Her mouth reminds me of the characters from Planet of the ape's.

I hate seeing her face too. She looks like a weird DNA mix of Peter Griffin, Will Ferell and a cabbage patch doll

And her "lips"....

Why are they so dirty looking?

Plus, I'll be glad when Amy is no longer famous like Lena Dunham. Bunch of no talent hacks.
