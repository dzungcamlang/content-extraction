This is a testing build of AOSP nougat. It's based on sources by sonyxperiadev, maintained by alviteri. (big thanks to him)

It's working quite well, just a few bugs:
>Camera doesn't focus well (tap to focus works, but it's slow)
>No deep sleep - Radio - ProxyController

Gapps included/built in

I'm sorry, but I don't have any. You should be able to get that from your stock rom - /system/etc/firmware - take all modem.* and mba.* files and replace them in this rom.

Um, no. You can't install rom for honami (xperia z1) on amami (xperia z1 c). You have to compile the rom on your own or wait till any1 compiles it for you.
