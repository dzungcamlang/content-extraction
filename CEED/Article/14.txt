Vitamin B-12, along with the other B vitamins, plays a crucial role in maintaining the health of your nervous system. It plays a particularly important role in nerve health and also helps in the manufacturing of DNA. Along with folate, vitamin B-12 helps to manufacture the mood-regulating compound SAM-e, or S-adenosylmethionine, which influences the production of serotonin. SAM-e is also sold as a dietary supplement that may help people with depression who do not respond to traditional antidepressant medications known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, according to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. If you are deficient in vitamin B-12, you may experience symptoms of fatigue, nervousness and depression, which may be related to a decrease in serotonin production.
