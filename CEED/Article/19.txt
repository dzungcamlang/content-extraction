These are the first pictures of the young couple who were allegedly stabbed to death on one of Britain's busiest high streets in the early hours of today.
Zoe Morgan, 21, and Lee Simmons, 33, who both worked for Matalan, were found dead outside the store on Queen Street in Cardiff, Wales, shortly before 6am.
The pair, who had been dating for less than four months, were reportedly killed in a knife attack as they left work together after finishing their overnight shifts.
Police say the 20-year-old suspect is believed to have been known to them.
Zoe, a window dresser for Matalan, and Lee, a shop assistant, had struck up a romance while working at the store near the popular St David's Shopping Centre.
