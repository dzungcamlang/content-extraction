The 2005 "Lipids in Health and Disease" study and another published in that journal in 2009, evaluated the effectiveness of Irvingia gabonensis seeds for weight loss. In the 2005 study, 28 participants took three 350-milligram capsules of the supplement three times per day for one month, while 12 participants took a placebo. The average body weight of the treatment group decreased by approximately 5 percent and that of the placebo group by approximately 1 percent, a statistically significant difference. Participants taking Irvingia gabonensis also experienced a significant decrease in total cholesterol and triglyceride blood levels. The 2009 study also found beneficial effects.
