The Fifth of September.
This is a great chapter.
Nearly three months have gone by, but Morrel still hasn't been able to come up with the money. He's totally distraught, and he doesn't know what to do. Where can he find the money? He can't. His name and his reputation are in ruins.
Morrel decides he's going to kill himself. He even tells his son, Maximillian, about this plan. Max agrees it's a good idea (whaa?).
But just before he's about to take his own life, Julie receives a letter from Sinbad the Sailor (drumroll please). She does everything Sinbad tells her to do, and, as a result, she finds the little red purse that Morrel had once given to Edmond's dad (Dantès Sr.) when he was on his deathbed. The little red purse is filled with documents that explain that Morrel's debts have been forgiven. AND it contains a big diamond that is specifically for Julie and her marriage to Emmanuel. Sweet.
And if that wasn't enough, a brand spanking new ship sails into the harbor – it's the new Pharaon.
Can you hear the shrieks of joy and the triumphant soundtrack getting louder and louder as the camera focuses on the happy scene in Morrel's home and then zooms out to the Marseille harbor and then zooms out even more, until Marseille is just a little dot on the horizon?
This is to say, our protagonist, Edmond is leaving Marseille.
