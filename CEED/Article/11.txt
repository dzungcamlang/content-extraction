Everybody knew Ozzy Osbourne because he was the lead singer of Black Sabboth and also because he bit off the head of a bat on stage that one time. But he really became famous when he let MTV film a reality TV show about him, his family and all about his domestic life! I used to watchÂ The Osbournes all the time. I LIVED for their drama and every weird thing the family would get up to. Remember when a dog therapist visited the house?! But by far, the weirdest part about the show was the blurred out figure lurking around the house. It was Aimee, the eldest daughter. And she's revealed why she was never on the show and why she's no longer close to the family!
