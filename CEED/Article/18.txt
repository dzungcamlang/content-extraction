<p>Awesome project, so simple even I could do it with limited tools!:)</p><p>This has inspired me.</p><p>I am thinking it might be simpler to create the &quot;triangle&quot; with separate glued/nailed &quot;strips&quot; instead of cutting it out of single piece.</p><p>Will require a bit more math to figure out angle cuts for the joints but would create less waste. Cut off narrow strips from my available scraps, cut to length, angle cut corners, glue/staple corners into triangles.</p><p>Going to try this with &quot;wireless&quot; remote controlled led lights for easy placement and no cords. I have low ceilings so very easy to reach corners to change batteries, but sadly I do not have enough plugs around for those dark corners. Wireless best way to go.</p><p>I have some long narrow wood scraps but not big enough to cut entire triangles from.</p>
