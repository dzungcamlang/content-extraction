“When I asked why I was being charged so much for some water the waiter rudely said, ‘well, do you know how much a lemon costs?’ Yes, it’s definitely not £2.
“He then went on to wrongly inform me that a 'pot of tea for one' (which is what I was charged for) is the same price as a lemon. To show just how ridiculous this is, my friend ordered a slice of chocolate cake which was £1.90.”.
Mr Fisher replied outlining the costs of paying a waiter, the time his staff spent serving her and the overheads for running his business, “which works out at £27.50 per hour of trading”, he wrote.
He added: “I pay my colleagues a decent living wage and after taking into account holiday pay, national insurance and non-productive time prior to opening and after closing, the waiter who served you costs me £12.50 per hour.
“I accept that it makes the price of a cuppa in a city centre cafe look expensive compared to the one you make at home but unfortunately that’s the cruel reality of life. It’s actually the facilities that cost the money, far more so than the ingredients.
“Perhaps, the rudeness that you perceived in me was triggered by the disrespect that I perceived in you by your presumption that you could use our facilities and be waited on for free.”.
For those who don't understand how restaurant overheads work, a great Trip Advisor response (via @ThomHetheringto) https://t.co/UhAZ1gJAt9— Jay Rayner (@jayrayner1) January 14, 2016.
Bloody hell. It appears @TripAdvisor have taken down both the review and the response. Extraordinary. Did anybody screenshot it?— Jay Rayner (@jayrayner1) January 14, 2016.
The post, which has since been deleted from TripAdvisor, went viral after being shared by food critic Jay Rayner.
